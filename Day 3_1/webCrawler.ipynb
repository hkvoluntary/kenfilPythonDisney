It's worth pointing out here that there are many other tools that offer this information, I've just chosen SEMrush as it is one of the more popular ones. You can input any domain you want and SEMrush gives you the organic traffic. This organic traffic number should be taken with a pinch of salt - it's an estimation of what SEMrush believe the domain receives from organic traffic. But how does it work?Visibility tools - how do they work?SEMrush has a large keyword database of searches made in Google and other search engines. They also track how many searches a particular keyword receives and they track what domains are ranking. So, for example, the keyword ‘football’ gets searched 1.2 million times per month (on average across a 12 month period). The BBC ranks in position 1 here, so SEMrush will estimate that perhaps 20% of those 1.2 million searches will go to the BBC on a monthly basis - that is 240,000 clicks just from the term ‘football’. When SEMrush combine and sum all the keywords that the BBC ranks for (based upon their keyword database) they get an estimate of what the BBC receives on a monthly basis.Estimating clicks - a simple functionIn the SEO world we often need to estimate organic traffic for a given keyword set for forecasting, for example if we can target a new segment of keywords or improve a ranking position of a keyword, how many clicks can we expect to recieve? Estimating clicks is a simple function monthly search volume for a keyword, the ranking position of a URL and an estimated click through rate.Below I have provided some industry average click through rates for different positions in search engines result pages within a Python dictionary. The function accepts search volume and a position for ranking keyword and applies a CTR based upon the position to return the estimated number of clicks from the given search term. ctr_dct = {1 : 0.18000,2 : 0.09000,3 : 0.07600,4 : 0.06000,5 : 0.05500,6 : 0.05000,7 : 0.03000,8 : 0.02250,9 : 0.01500,10 : 0.01000,11 : 0.00850,12 : 0.00800,13 : 0.00750,14 : 0.00700,15 : 0.00650,16 : 0.00600,17 : 0.00550,18 : 0.00500,19 : 0.0050,20 : 0.00450,21 : 0.00385,22 : 0.00370,23 : 0.00355,24 : 0.0030,25 : 0.00325,26 : 0.00310,27 : 0.00295,28 : 0.00280,29 : 0.00265,30 : 0.00200,31 : 0.00190,32 : 0.00180,33 : 0.00170,34 : 0.00160,35 : 0.00150,36 : 0.0010,37 : 0.00130,38 : 0.00120,39 : 0.00110,40 : 0.00100,41 : 0.00090,42 : 0.00080,43 : 0.00070,44 : 0.00060,45 : 0.00050,46 : 0.00040,47 : 0.00030,48 : 0.00020,  49 : 0.00010,50 : 0.00000}def estimted_clicks(position, sv):  # pass in a postion for search volume for a keyword  sv       = int(sv)  position = int(position)  if position in ctr_dct:    return ctr_dct[position] * sv  return 0Passing a position and search volume into my function returns an estimated number of clicks. For example, the keyword 'seo visibility' gets 170 searches per month - in the unlikely event this blog posts ranks in position 1 for this keyword I could expect recieve 31 clicks per month. This is of course is a very rough guess - the CTR is likely to be different to my estimated 18% and the post may rank for other keywords.estimted_clicks(1, 170)# returns 30.59ConcludingStakeholders will nearly always ask what the return on investment will be from producing content and this is perhaps the most likely reason you need to do forecasting. SEO forecasting is exceptionally challenging with a huge number of variables, and simply showing the number of clicks an article could produce in a best guess position is often the best way to get buy in.CategoriesPython programmingPython basicsPython packagesData scienceSEOSEOWeb developmentJavaScriptCSSPHPHTMLSQLPopular postsNumpy basicsMatplotlib basicsPandas basicsPandas basics- part 2Python functions overviewList, dictionary & generator comprehensionMySQL & SQL in PythonCategorising keywords at scale with NLTKSimple Python web crawler with SQLiteCrawling sites using AJAX with SeleniumSitemap  |    Learning Resources  |    Copyright © charlieojackson.co.uk 2019 |\tJS Test \n","Total links count: 26 \n","\n","Loop Counter: 7 - Crawling: https://charlieojackson.co.uk/?search=seo+forecast \n","Page title: Charlie Jackson | Blogging about Python programming, SEO and web development \n","Page description: The blog of Charlie Jackson; SEO, Python programming, web development tutorials and code examples. \n","Page contents: Charlie Jackson | Blogging about Python programming, SEO and web developmentCharlie JacksonAbout me            (current)PortfolioSEO, Python programming and web developmentSimple SEO forecastingIn this post we look at working out clicks for a given keyword using its monthly search volume, ranking position and an estimated click through rate.Read More → Posted: 08-10-2022 Tagged: seo forecast,  forecast← Older SearchCategoriesPython programmingPython basicsPython packagesData scienceSEOSEOWeb developmentJavaScriptCSSPHPHTMLSQLPopular postsNumpy basicsMatplotlib basicsPandas basicsPandas basics- part 2Python functions overviewList, dictionary & generator comprehensionMySQL & SQL in PythonCategorising keywords at scale with NLTKSimple Python web crawler with SQLiteCrawling sites using AJAX with SeleniumSitemap  |    Learning Resources  |    Copyright © charlieojackson.co.uk 2019 |\tJS Test \n","Total links count: 29 \n","\n","Loop Counter: 8 - Crawling: https://charlieojackson.co.uk/?search=forecast \n","Page title: Charlie Jackson | Blogging about Python programming, SEO and web development \n","Page description: The blog of Charlie Jackson; SEO, Python programming, web development tutorials and code examples. \n","Page contents: Charlie Jackson | Blogging about Python programming, SEO and web developmentCharlie JacksonAbout me            (current)PortfolioSEO, Python programming and web developmentSimple SEO forecastingIn this post we look at working out clicks for a given keyword using its monthly search volume, ranking position and an estimated click through rate.Read More → Posted: 08-10-2022 Tagged: seo forecast,  forecast← Older SearchCategoriesPython programmingPython basicsPython packagesData scienceSEOSEOWeb developmentJavaScriptCSSPHPHTMLSQLPopular postsNumpy basicsMatplotlib basicsPandas basicsPandas basics- part 2Python functions overviewList, dictionary & generator comprehensionMySQL & SQL in PythonCategorising keywords at scale with NLTKSimple Python web crawler with SQLiteCrawling sites using AJAX with SeleniumSitemap  |    Learning Resources  |    Copyright © charlieojackson.co.uk 2019 |\tJS Test \n","Total links count: 29 \n","\n","Loop Counter: 9 - Crawling: https://charlieojackson.co.uk/python/weighted_average_rank.php \n","Page title: Weighted average rank in Pandas | Charlie Jackson \n","Page description: In this post we look how you can get the weighted average in Pandas \n","Page contents: Weighted average rank in Pandas | Charlie JacksonCharlie JacksonAbout me            (current)PortfolioWeighted average rank in Pandas            by            Charlie JacksonPosted on June, 2021 at 12:00 PMIn this tutorial we'll be looking at average weighted ranks in Pythons Pandas package. Find the code below in my github repo.InstallSimple weighted averageGroupby using weighted averageInstallsFor this Tutorial, we just be using Pandas. Pandas is not install by default, so you must install via pip:pip install pandas\t\t\t\tSimple weighted averageFor the purpose of the example, I will create a simple DataFrame with some keywords their search volume and their ranking position (this is fictious data but you could imagine how a domain might rank for these keywords in varying positions). The weighted average will be based upon the position.                To get the weighted average, we have to do three steps.                Determine the weight percetangeMultiply the value by the weight percentageSum the weighted values                For the first two steps we will add two aditional columns to our DataFrame, with the code below. In the first step, we take take the weight percentage of the total. In the second step we multiply the weight percent by the value (the value we are trying to get the weight for).             df = pd.DataFrame({'keyword':['sofa', 'sofa grey', 'sofa red'], 'avg_sv':[1000,100,10], 'pos':[1, 10, 20]})df['weight_pct'] = df['avg_sv'] / df['avg_sv'].sum()df['weight_actual'] = df['pos'] * df['weight_pct']\t\t\t\tNow we have the weighted value, all we need to do is sum the column and we will have the weighted average rank.df['weight_actual'].sum()\t\t\t\tAdditionally you could refactor the steps into a function which you run on the DataFrame:def add_weight_column(pos, weight):  weight_pct    = weight / df['avg_sv'].sum()  weight_actual = weight_pct * pos  return [weight_pct, weight_actual]for index, row in df.iterrows():  pos    = row['pos']  weight = row['avg_sv']  weight_pct, weight_actual = add_weight_column(pos, weight)  df.loc[index,'weight_pct']    = weight_pct  df.loc[index,'weight_actual'] = weight_actualdf.weight_actual.sum()\t\t\t\tGroupby using weighted averageThe next weighted average is used with a groupby - i.e. we can get the weighted average rank for a specific group. For this I have created a similar DataFrame, but added a category for the keywords.df = pd.DataFrame({'keyword':['table', 'wood table', 'round table', 'sofa grey', '2 seater sofa', 'wooden chair', 'rocking chair'], 'group':['table', 'table','table', 'sofa', 'sofa', 'chair', 'chair'], 'avg_sv':[1000,100,10, 200, 100, 500, 1000], 'pos':[1, 10, 20, 15, 11, 16, 9]})\t\t\t\tWe use typical Pandas groupby syntax, but we will apply a custom function passing in the position and weighting value (which is average search volume), like so:def wavg(group, avg_name, weight_name):    d = group[avg_name]    w = group[weight_name]    try:        return (d * w).sum() / w.sum()    except ZeroDivisionError:        return d.mean()df.groupby('group').apply(wavg, 'pos', 'avg_sv').to_frame().rename(columns={0:'weighted average rank'})\t\t\t\tThe result is a DataFrame with all the weighted average positions over the group or product type in this instance.CategoriesPython programmingPython basicsPython packagesData scienceSEOSEOWeb developmentJavaScriptCSSPHPHTMLSQLPopular postsNumpy basicsMatplotlib basicsPandas basicsPandas basics- part 2Python functions overviewList, dictionary & generator comprehensionMySQL & SQL in PythonCategorising keywords at scale with NLTKSimple Python web crawler with SQLiteCrawling sites using AJAX with SeleniumSitemap  |    Learning Resources  |    Copyright © charlieojackson.co.uk 2019 |\tJS Test \n","Total links count: 30 \n","\n","Loop Counter: 10 - Crawling: https://charlieojackson.co.uk/?search=weighted+average \n","Page title: Charlie Jackson | Blogging about Python programming, SEO and web development \n","Page description: The blog of Charlie Jackson;

NumPy is an essential package for data science tool kits and well worth taking the time to learn.What is NumPy?Installing NumPyNumPy BasicsCode takeawayWhat is NumPy?Numpy is a library  used for scientific computing. In a nutshell it can compute using arrays much faster and simply than a doing the same operation with a python list.Installing NumPyNumPy is not installed by default and thus must be installed using pip:pip install numpy\t\t\t\tNumPy basicsOnce installed, you must import NumPy; the convention is to \"import numpy as np\" as depicted below. After that can create an array by passing in a list of values. In this case, we are looking at some made up data for height and weight to compute BMI. Note, when adding lists together, the add works like concatenation. With a NumPy array, the respective numbers are added together from the two arrays.>>> import numpy as np>>>>>> height = [1.73, 1.68, 1.71, 1.89, 1.79]>>> weight = [65.4, 59.2, 63.6, 88.4, 68.7]>>> >>> np_height = np.array(height)>>> np_weight = np.array(weight)>>> >>> bmi = np_weight / np_height ** 2>>> bmiarray([21.85171573, 20.97505669, 21.75028214, 24.7473475 , 21.44127836])>>> >>> height + height[1.73, 1.68, 1.71, 1.89, 1.79, 1.73, 1.68, 1.71, 1.89, 1.79]>>> >>> np_height + np_heightarray([3.46, 3.36, 3.42, 3.78, 3.58])\t\t\t\t Subsetting/ slicing arraysAs with a python list you can slice based upon a index number. You can also apply logic which returns an array of Booleans, or slice with the logic.>>> bmiarray([21.85171573, 20.97505669, 21.75028214, 24.7473475 , 21.44127836])>>> >>> bmi[0]21.85171572722109>>> >>> bmi > 23array([False, False, False,  True, False])>>> >>> bmi[bmi > 23]array([24.7473475])>>> \t\t\t\t2 dimensional arraysYou can have 2 dimensional NumPy arrays. Calling the \"shape\" attribute shows how the array is structured (in this case 2 rows and 5 columns). You can also slice 2d arrays as with a 1d array; array[row, column].\t\t\t>>> np_2d = np.array([[1.73, 1.68, 1.71, 1.89, 1.79], [65.4, 59.2, 63.6, 88.4, 68.7]])>>> np_2darray([[ 1.73,  1.68,  1.71,  1.89,  1.79],       [65.4 , 59.2 , 63.6 , 88.4 , 68.7 ]])>>> >>> np_2d.shape(2, 5)>>>>>> np_2d[0]array([1.73, 1.68, 1.71, 1.89, 1.79])>>>>>> np_2d[0][2]1.71>>>>>> np_2d[0,2] # this is a preferable way to slice although the line above also works1.71>>>>>> np_2d[:,1:3]array([[ 1.68,  1.71],       [59.2 , 63.6 ]])>>> \t\t\t\tNote, you cannot store two different types of data in an array; one data type will be converted to match the other. Take a look at the following example where the integers are converted to strings:\t\t\t\t>>> test = np.array([[1,2,3],['a','b','c']])>>> testarray([['1', '2', '3'],       ['a', 'b', 'c']], dtype=\"\") \t\t\t\tBoolean operatorsYou can also do more complex queries using Boolean operators. Typically in Python you will see an equation that may look like this:>>> x = 10>>> x > 5 and x < 15True>>>\t\t\t\tWhen using a NumPy array you must use:logical_and()logical_or()logical_not()>>> np.logical_and(np_2d > 1.8, np_2d < 80)array([[False, False, False,  True, False],       [ True,  True,  True, False,  True]])>>>>>> np_2d[np.logical_and(np_2d > 1.8, np_2d < 80)]array([ 1.89, 65.4 , 59.2 , 63.6 , 68.7 ])>>> \t\t\t\tBasic statistical analysisThe main use of NumPy is to do statistical analysis across big data sets. For this example, I have generated some random data to use (symbolising height and weight) across a sample of 5000. We can then analysis things like the sum, mean, mode, standard deviation, correlation and much more. In this example, we take a slice to get all the heights and subsequently work out the mean, median, correlation and standard deviation.>>> height = np.round(np.random.normal(1.75, 0.20, 5000), 2)# distribution mean, distribution standard deviation, number of samples>>> weight = np.round(np.random.normal(60.32, 15, 5000), 2)>>> np_city = np.column_stack((height, weight)) # merge the two data sets together>>>>>> np.mean(np_city[:,0])# this slice gets all the rows for the height column1.751134>>> >>> np.median(np_city[:,0])1.75>>>>>> np.corrcoef(np_city[:,0], np_city[:,1])array([[1.        , 0.00718604],       [0.00718604, 1.        ]])>>> >>> np.std(np_city[:,0])0.19722589597717638>>>\t\t\tdir(np_city)Don't forget you can always use built in functions like help(), dir() and type() as these are useful to work out what else you can do with your data. Notice, the additional functions like sum, min, max which are useful ways to check out your data>>> dir(np_city)['T', '__abs__', '__add__', '__and__', '__array__', '__array_finalize__', '__array_interface__', '__array_prepare__', '__array_priority__', '__array_struct__', '__array_ufunc__', '__array_wrap__', '__bool__', '__class__', '__complex__', '__contains__', '__copy__', '__deepcopy__', '__delattr__', '__delitem__', '__dir__', '__divmod__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__float__', '__floordiv__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getitem__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__iadd__', '__iand__', '__ifloordiv__', '__ilshift__', '__imatmul__', '__imod__', '__imul__', '__index__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__int__', '__invert__', '__ior__', '__ipow__', '__irshift__', '__isub__', '__iter__', '__itruediv__', '__ixor__', '__le__', '__len__', '__lshift__', '__lt__', '__matmul__', '__mod__', '__mul__', '__ne__', '__neg__', '__new__', '__or__', '__pos__', '__pow__', '__radd__', '__rand__', '__rdivmod__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__rfloordiv__', '__rlshift__', '__rmatmul__', '__rmod__', '__rmul__', '__ror__', '__rpow__', '__rrshift__', '__rshift__', '__rsub__', '__rtruediv__', '__rxor__', '__setattr__', '__setitem__', '__setstate__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__sub__', '__subclasshook__', '__truediv__', '__xor__', 'all', 'any', 'argmax', 'argmin', 'argpartition', 'argsort', 'astype', 'base', 'byteswap', 'choose', 'clip', 'compress', 'conj', 'conjugate', 'copy', 'ctypes', 'cumprod', 'cumsum', 'data', 'diagonal', 'dot', 'dtype', 'dump', 'dumps', 'fill', 'flags', 'flat', 'flatten', 'getfield', 'imag', 'item', 'itemset', 'itemsize', 'max', 'mean', 'min', 'nbytes', 'ndim', 'newbyteorder', 'nonzero', 'partition', 'prod', 'ptp', 'put', 'ravel', 'real', 'repeat', 'reshape', 'resize', 'round', 'searchsorted', 'setfield', 'setflags', 'shape', 'size', 'sort', 'squeeze', 'std', 'strides', 'sum', 'swapaxes', 'take', 'tobytes', 'tofile', 'tolist', 'tostring', 'trace', 'transpose', 'var', 'view']>>>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIts worth also point out that you can loop through arrays as you would also data types in Python, but if you find yourself doing this, you may want to check this is the correct thing to be doing.Code takeawayimport numpy as npheight = [1.73, 1.68, 1.71, 1.89, 1.79]weight = [65.4, 59.2, 63.6, 88.4, 68.7]np_height = np.array(height)np_weight = np.array(weight)bmi = np_weight / np_height ** 2x = bmi>23print(x)print(type(x))print(bmi)print(bmi[0])print(bmi > 23)print(bmi[bmi > 23])np_2d = np.array([[1.73, 1.68, 1.71, 1.89, 1.79],[65.4, 59.2, 63.6, 88.4, 68.7]])print(np_2d)print(np_2d.shape)print(np_2d[0])print(np_2d[0][2])print(np_2d[0,2])print(np_2d[:,1:3])height = np.round(np.random.normal(1.75, 0.20, 5000), 2)# distribution mean, distribution standard deviation, number of samplesweight = np.round(np.random.normal(60.32, 15, 5000), 2)np_city = np.column_stack((height, weight)) # merge the two data sets togetherprint(np.mean(np_city[:,0]))# this slice gets all the rows for the height columnprint(np.median(np_city[:,0]))print(np.corrcoef(np_city[:,0], np_city[:,1]))print(np.std(np_city[:,0]))print(dir(np_city))\t\t\t\tCategoriesPython programmingPython basicsPython packagesData scienceSEOSEOWeb developmentJavaScriptCSSPHPHTMLSQLPopular postsNumpy basicsMatplotlib basicsPandas basicsPandas basics- part 2Python functions overviewList, dictionary & generator comprehensionMySQL & SQL in PythonCategorising keywords at scale with NLTKSimple Python web crawler with SQLiteCrawling sites using AJAX with SeleniumSitemap  |    Learning Resources  |    Copyright © charlieojackson.co.uk 2019 |\tJS Test \n","Total links count: 30 \n","\n","Loop Counter: 23 - Crawling: https://charlieojackson.co.uk/python/matplotlib-basics.php \n","Page title: Matplotlib basics | Charlie Jackson \n","Page description: In this post we look at the very basic features of the Matplotlib package in Python.

Matplotlib is used to create beautiful graphs from your data and is essential part of the data science tool kitWhat is Matplotlib?Matplotlib BasicsCode takeawayWhat is Matplotlib?Matplotlib Basics is a library used for scientific computing. Matplotlib makes graphically representing your data easier in the form or line graphs, bar charts, histograms and much more.Matplotlib basicsMatplotlib comes installed with the Python download - as with all packages you must import them into your script; the convention is \"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\":import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\t\t\t\tOnce imported, you can plot two lists against one another very simply. Note, for this example I have just made up some random data for age and income. Additionally, you can then customise the graph using colours, labels and ticks (used to replace axis labels to be more readable / relevant). Note, you must always finish by telling python to show the graph.>>>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt>>>>>>age = [18,24,32,47,51,63]>>>income = [19000,29000,55000,81000,120000,65000]>>>>>>plt.plot(age,income)>>>>>>plt.xlabel('Age')>>>plt.ylabel('Income')>>>plt.title('Age versus income')>>>plt.yticks([19000,29000,55000,81000,120000,65000],[\"19k\",\"29k\",\"55k\",\"81k\",\"120k\",\"65k\"])>>>>>>plt.show()>>>        Other graphsScattergramsWith a bit of simple customisation of the above code, we can make a variety of graphs. Replace \"plt.plot()\" to \"plt.scatter()\" to change from a line graph to a scatter graph - note I have commented out the first line below.>>>#plt.plot(age,income)>>>plt.scatter(age,income)        HistogramsHistograms bucket data together and graph based upon the count within each bucket. For histograms we need a slightly different data set; imagine this is average daily weather temperature records for August in London (again, this is made up data).>>> import random>>> weather = [random.randint(20,35) for x in range(30)]>>> weather[20, 30, 31, 35, 35, 23, 32, 20, 25, 30, 30, 33, 29, 27, 23, 33, 28, 25, 33, 33, 32, 35, 28, 35, 26, 32, 22, 29, 35, 35]>>>>>>plt.hist(weather) # you can add a parameter to change the number of buckets, i.e. plt.hist(weather,5)>>>plt.xlabel('Tempurature')>>>plt.ylabel('No of days')>>>plt.title('Age versus income')        Bubble graphsThe final graph we will look at is a bubble graph; these show 3 data points on a single graph. For this graph we will look at medals at the Olympic games, GDP and population. Note, this is essentially the same as a scatter graph although we pass in a size \"s=\" in the parameter in the form of a NumPy array - this could be a list, however the bubbles were too small thus it was converted and increased in size. >>>olympic_medals = [41,56,0,1,0,19,3,121,2,70]>>>gdp_per_capita = [38428, 10743, 1516, 1968, 1547, 9821, 3846, 59531, 1939,8826]>>>population = [1.2,1.4,1.5,1.9,2.07,2.08,2.6,3.2,12.9,13.8]>>>np_population = np.array(population)>>>np_population = np_population * 20>>>plt.scatter(gdp_per_capita,olympic_medals, s=population)>>>plt.xscale('log')>>>plt.xlabel('GDP per Capita [in USD]')>>>plt.ylabel('Olympic medals')>>>plt.title('Olympic medals, GDP and population')>>>plt.show()        Code takeawayThe majority of the code is blanked out, although uncommenting certain parts will show a variety of different graphs.import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as np# LINE GRAPH#age = [18,24,32,47,51,63]#income = [19000,29000,55000,81000,120000,65000]#plt.plot(age,income)#plt.scatter(age,income)#plt.xlabel('Age')#plt.title('Age versus income')#plt.yticks([19000,29000,55000,81000,120000,65000],[\"19k\",\"29k\",\"55k\",\"81k\",\"120k\",\"65k\"])#plt.show()# HISTOGRAM# create some random data for weather#import random#weather = [random.randint(20,35) for x in range(30)]#plt.hist(weather) # you can add a parameter to change the number of buckets, i.e. plt.hist(weather,5)#plt.xlabel('Tempurature')#plt.ylabel('No of days')#plt.title('Weather over August - London')#plt.show()# BUBBLE GRAPHolympic_medals = [41,56,0,1,0,19,3,121,2,70]gdp_per_capita = [38428, 10743, 1516, 1968, 1547, 9821, 3846, 59531, 1939,8826]population = [1.2,1.4,1.5,1.9,2.07,2.08,2.6,3.2,12.9,13.8]np_population = np.array(population) # pass list into a NumPy arraynp_population = np_population * 20 # Increase the size of the bubblesplt.scatter(gdp_per_capita,olympic_medals, s=population)plt.xscale('log')plt.xlabel('GDP per Capita [in USD]')plt.ylabel('Olympic medals')plt.title('Olympic medals, GDP and population')plt.show()         CategoriesPython programmingPython basicsPython packagesData scienceSEOSEOWeb developmentJavaScriptCSSPHPHTMLSQLPopular postsNumpy basicsMatplotlib basicsPandas basicsPandas basics- part 2Python functions overviewList, dictionary & generator comprehensionMySQL & SQL in PythonCategorising keywords at scale with NLTKSimple Python web crawler with SQLiteCrawling sites using AJAX with SeleniumSitemap  |    Learning Resources  |    Copyright © charlieojackson.co.uk 2019 |\tJS Test \n","Total links count: 30 \n","\n","Loop Counter: 24 - Crawling: https://charlieojackson.co.uk/python/pandas-basics.php \n","Page title: Pandas basics - loading data, filtering and querying | Charlie Jackson \n","Page description: In this post we look at the very basic features of the Pandas package in Python; a hugely popular package in data science.

The code below shows how to pass a list and a CSV.>>> import pandas as pd>>> names = ['United States', 'Australia', 'Japan', 'India', 'Russia', 'Morocco', 'Egypt']>>> dr =  [True, False, False, False, True, True, True]>>> cpc = [809, 731, 588, 18, 200, 70, 45]>>> diction = { 'country':names, 'drives_right':dr, 'cars_per_cap':cpc }>>> cars = pd.DataFrame(diction)>>> row_labels = ['US', 'AUS', 'JAP', 'IN', 'RU', 'MOR', 'EG']>>> cars.index = row_labels>>> cars           country  drives_right  cars_per_capUS   United States          True           809AUS      Australia         False           731JAP          Japan         False           588IN           India         False            18RU          Russia          True           200MOR        Morocco          True            70EG           Egypt          True            45\t\t\t\t Alternatively, you can pass in a csv. Note, when passing a CSV you can specify which column you want to set as the index label.>>> cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col=0)>>> cars           country  drives_right  cars_per_capUS   United States          True           809AUS      Australia         False           731JAP          Japan         False           588IN           India         False            18RU          Russia          True           200MOR        Morocco          True            70EG           Egypt          True            45\t\t\t Accessing columnsYou can access the columns using a number of ways that will return a data series of data frame depending upon on how you slice the DataFrame. The most simply way is to use square brackets. The final example in the code block shows how you effectively pass in a list to return multiple columns.>>> cars['country']US     United StatesAUS        AustraliaJAP            JapanIN             IndiaRU            RussiaMOR          MoroccoEG             EgyptName: country, dtype: object>>>>>> type(cars['country'])'pandas.core.series.Series'>>>>>> cars[['country']]           countryUS   United StatesAUS      AustraliaJAP          JapanIN           IndiaRU          RussiaMOR        MoroccoEG           Egypt>>>>>> type(cars[['country']])'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>>> cars[['country','drives_right']]           country  drives_rightUS   United States          TrueAUS      Australia         FalseJAP          Japan         FalseIN           India         FalseRU          Russia          TrueMOR        Morocco          TrueEG           Egypt          True>>> \t\t\tAlthough the above works quite effectively for simple slicing, Pandas has a more advanced way that slices based upon rows and columns; DataFrame[rows, columns]. To use this feature you must use the loc or iloc attributes:loc = label basediloc = integer based>>> cars.loc['US'] # returns data seriescountry         United Statesdrives_right             Truecars_per_cap              809Name: US, dtype: object >>> cars.loc[['US']] # returns data frame          country  drives_right  cars_per_capUS  United States          True           809>>>>>> cars.loc[['US','JAP']]           country  drives_right  cars_per_capUS   United States          True           809JAP          Japan         False           588>>>>>>>>> cars.iloc[0]country         United Statesdrives_right             Truecars_per_cap              809Name: US, dtype: object>>>>>> cars.iloc[[1]]       country  drives_right  cars_per_capAUS  Australia         False           731>>> cars.iloc[[0,1]]           country  drives_right  cars_per_capUS   United States          True           809AUS      Australia         False           731>>>\t\t\tFinally, as noted previously, you can slice with DataFrame[rows, columns]. Note in the final code block, how you can replace the list with a colon to get all the rows. The respective syntax will also work with iloc.>>> cars.loc[['US','JAP'],['country','drives_right']]           country  drives_rightUS   United States          TrueJAP          Japan         False>>> >>> cars.loc[:,['country', 'drives_right']]           country  drives_rightUS   United States          TrueAUS      Australia         FalseJAP          Japan         FalseIN           India         FalseRU          Russia          TrueMOR        Morocco          TrueEG           Egypt          True>>> \t\t\tSummary of accessing columnsSquare bracketsColumn access: cars['country']Row access: cars[1:4]loc (label based)Row access: cars.loc[['AUS','US']]Column access: cars.loc[:,['country','drives_right']]Row and Column: cars.loc[['US','AUS'],['country','drives_right']]Filtering Pandas DataFrameThere are three steps to querying a DataFrameSelect the area column - this must return a Pandas SeriesDo comparison on area column - this must return a Boolean seriesUse result / Boolean to index and return new DataFrame>>> cf = cars['cars_per_cap']>>> sl = cf > 500>>> cars[sl]           country  drives_right  cars_per_capUS   United States          True           809AUS      Australia         False           731JAP          Japan         False           588>>>\t\t\tNote, this can be done on one line as so:>>> cars[cars['cars_per_cap'] > 500]           country  drives_right  cars_per_capUS   United States          True           809AUS      Australia         False           731JAP          Japan         False           588>>> \t\t\tAs with NumPy, you must use logical_and, logical_or method operators for more than one query. You must import (\"import numpy as np\") at the top of your script to use the logical_and() method.>>> cars[np.logical_and(cars['cars_per_cap'] >= 100, cars['cars_per_cap'] <= 500)]   country  drives_right  cars_per_capRU  Russia          True           200>>> \t\t\tCode takeawayCurrently there is a lot of prints being executed in the terminal; it’s worth playing around, commenting out certain print statements to identify what exactly is going on.import pandas as pdimport numpy as npnames = ['United States', 'Australia', 'Japan', 'India', 'Russia', 'Morocco', 'Egypt']dr =  [True, False, False, False, True, True, True]cpc = [809, 731, 588, 18, 200, 70, 45]diction = { 'country':names, 'drives_right':dr, 'cars_per_cap':cpc }cars = pd.DataFrame(diction)row_labels = ['US', 'AUS', 'JAP', 'IN', 'RU', 'MOR', 'EG']cars.index = row_labelsprint(cars) # returns data frame# basic square brackets to get indexprint(cars['country']) # gets column,returns seriesprint(type(cars['country'])) #print(cars[['country']]) # gets column, returns dataframeprint(type(cars[['country']]))print(cars[['country','drives_right']]) # mutilple columns, returns dataframe# iloc (integer) and loc (label)print(cars.loc['US']) # returns data seriesprint(cars.loc[['US']]) # returns data frameprint(cars.loc[['US','JAP']]) # returns multiple columns in data frameprint(cars.iloc[0]) # returns data seriesprint(cars.iloc[[1]]) # returns data frameprint(cars.iloc[[0,1]]) # returns multiple columns in data frameprint(cars.loc[['US','JAP'],['country','drives_right']]) # returns specific rows and columns in data frameprint(cars.loc[:,['country', 'drives_right']]) # returns all rows but specific columns in data frame# querying data frame - 3 stepscf = cars['cars_per_cap'] # step 1 - select area column to return a seriessl = cf > 500 # step 2 - do comparison to return boolean seriesprint(cars[sl]) step 3 - use result to index dataframe# one linerprint(cars[cars['cars_per_cap'] > 500])# multiple queries using logical andprint(cars[np.logical_and(cars['cars_per_cap'] >= 100, cars['cars_per_cap'] <= 500)])\t\t\t\tCategoriesPython programmingPython basicsPython packagesData scienceSEOSEOWeb developmentJavaScriptCSSPHPHTMLSQLPopular postsNumpy basicsMatplotlib basicsPandas basicsPandas basics- part 2Python functions overviewList, dictionary & generator comprehensionMySQL & SQL in PythonCategorising keywords at scale with NLTKSimple Python web crawler with SQLiteCrawling sites using AJAX with SeleniumSitemap  |    Learning Resources  |    Copyright © charlieojackson.co.uk 2019 |\tJS Test \n","Total links count: 31 \n","\n","Loop Counter: 25 - Crawling: https://charlieojackson.co.uk/python/pandas-basics-part-2.php \n","Page title: Pandas basics - looping through DataFrames and adding columns | Charlie Jackson \n","Page description: In this post we look in more depth at the python package Pandas; namely, looping through dataframes and adding columns. \n","Page contents: Pandas basics - looping through DataFrames and adding columns | Charlie JacksonCharlie JacksonAbout me            (current)PortfolioPandas basics - part 2            by            Charlie JacksonPosted on March 15, 2019 at 12:00 PMIn the previous tutorial, titled \"Pandas basics\" we looked at creating a DataFrame from dictionaries, accessing columns and querying the DataFrame using brackets, iloc and iloc.

These can be installed using pippip install pandaspip install numpy\t\t\t\tFor all the preceeding code, you will need to import the respective packages below.>>> import numpy as np>>> import pandas as pd>>>\t\t\t\tDataFrames and loopsIf you are familiar with the basic concepts of loops, you will comfortable with typical loops through strings, lists,dictionaries etc.Looping through a list is quite straight forward as depicted below. You can also use the keyword \"enumerate\", which ties an index key to the value in the list.>>> names = ['United States', 'Australia', 'Japan', 'India', 'Russia', 'Morocco', 'Egypt']>>> for name in names:\t\t\tprint(name)United StatesAustraliaJapanIndiaRussiaMoroccoEgypt>>>>>> for index, value in enumerate(names):\tprint(index, value)0 United States1 Australia2 Japan3 India4 Russia5 Morocco6 Egypt>>>\t\t\t\tLooping through a dictionary is near enough the same as the list, although you must 'append .items()' onto the dictionary:>>> country_dict = {'England':'London', 'France':'Paris', 'Germany':'Berlin', 'Spain':'Madrid'}>>> for country, city in country_dict.items():\tprint(\"The capital of \" + country + \" is \" + city)The capital of England is LondonThe capital of France is ParisThe capital of Germany is BerlinThe capital of Spain is Madrid>>>\t\t\t\tWith DataFrames, you can loop through as you would a list to get the column titles or append .iterrows(). Note, if it is a NumPy array, you can do the same with np.nditer([numpy array]). Note what is returned is a Series, not a DataFrame.>>> names = ['United States', 'Australia', 'Japan', 'India', 'Russia', 'Morocco', 'Egypt']>>> dr =  [True, False, False, False, True, True, True]>>> cpc = [809, 731, 588, 18, 200, 70, 45]>>> diction = { 'country':names, 'drives_right':dr, 'cars_per_cap':cpc }>>> cars = pd.DataFrame(diction)>>> row_labels = ['US', 'AUS', 'JAP', 'IN', 'RU', 'MOR', 'EG']>>> cars.index = row_labels>>> cars           country  drives_right  cars_per_capUS   United States          True           809AUS      Australia         False           731JAP          Japan         False           588IN           India         False            18RU          Russia          True           200MOR        Morocco          True            70EG           Egypt          True            45>>>>>> for car in cars:\tprint(car)countrydrives_rightcars_per_cap>>>>>> for lab, row in cars.iterrows():\tprint(lab)\tprint(row)UScountry         United Statesdrives_right             Truecars_per_cap              809Name: US, dtype: objectAUScountry         Australiadrives_right        Falsecars_per_cap          731Name: AUS, dtype: objectJAPcountry         Japandrives_right    Falsecars_per_cap      588Name: JAP, dtype: objectETCETC>>>\t\t\t\tTo loop through the DataFrame and grab certain data (not a whole series) we can apply square brackets or use loc (label based) or iloc (integer based) to filter the Series.>>> for lab, row in cars.iterrows():\tprint(row['country']) # this is the same as loc\tprint(row.loc['country'])\tprint(row.iloc[0])United StatesUnited StatesUnited StatesAustraliaAustraliaAustraliaJapanJapanJapanIndiaIndiaIndiaRussiaRussiaRussiaMoroccoMoroccoMoroccoEgyptEgyptEgypt>>>\t\t\t\tAdding columns to a DataFrameYou can simply add a column using the same syntax as you would a dictionary>>> cars['test'] = 0>>> cars           country  drives_right  cars_per_cap  testUS   United States          True           809     0AUS      Australia         False           731     0JAP          Japan         False           588     0IN           India         False            18     0RU          Russia          True           200     0MOR        Morocco          True            70     0EG           Egypt          True            45     0>>>\t\t\t\tClearly this is useless, so let’s delete it and add something which might be slightly more applicable.>>> del cars['test']>>> cars           country  drives_right  cars_per_capUS   United States          True           809AUS      Australia         False           731JAP          Japan         False           588IN           India         False            18RU          Russia          True           200MOR        Morocco          True            70EG           Egypt          True            45>>>\t\t\t\tTo add a new column and values we can either use a for loop (not optimal - imagine you have millions of rows) or use an 'apply' function.>>> for lab, row in cars.iterrows():\tcars.loc[lab, 'COUNTRY'] = row['country'].upper()>>> cars           country  drives_right  cars_per_cap        COUNTRYUS   United States          True           809  UNITED STATESAUS      Australia         False           731      AUSTRALIAJAP          Japan         False           588          JAPANIN           India         False            18          INDIARU          Russia          True           200         RUSSIAMOR        Morocco          True            70        MOROCCOEG           Egypt          True            45          EGYPT>>>\t\t\t\tNote how we have created a new column and inserted based upon the label in the for loop (so the data is inserted into the correct row) and also applied a function to our new data.

It will start with the basics and gradually get more complex. Topics covered include:Basic functions- no parameters, with parameters and default parametersNested functionsScope*args and **kwargsLambdas, maps and filtersFunctions and Panda DataFramesCode takeawayBefore diving into creating functions, it's worth thinking about what a function actually is. In essence, it's a code that does a very specific task. So instead of creating a long script that does lots of things, you want to break it up into lots of functions that do specific jobs simply and efficiently .Basic functionsIn their most simplest  forms, you can create a function with no parameters.>>> def hello():      print('hello')>>> hello()'hello'            The code above simply prints out 'hello' - you can also 'return' some data and store it in a variable, i.e. so you can use what is returned from the function later on in your program.>>> def hello():      return 'hello'>>> hello = hello()>>> hello'hello'            Moving on from the simplest function, we can then create a functiona which take parameters and use unique data that is passed to the function.>>> def hello(name):      return 'hello ' + name + ' you ledge'>>> hello('james')'hello james you ledge'>>> hello('scott')'hello scott you ledge'            When you create a function you can use as many parameters as you want. In addition you can also return as much data as required.>>> def hello(fname, lname):      nice_greeting = 'hello ' + fname + ' ' + lname + ' you ledge'      unpleasant_greeting = 'hello ' + fname + ' ' + lname + ' you idiot'      responses = (nice_greeting, unpleasant_greeting) # this creates a tuple named responses      return responses>>> nice, unpleasant = hello('james', 'bond')>>> nice'hello james bond you ledge'>>> unpleasant'hello james bond you idiot'            Lastly, you can have default parameters if nothing is passed when the function is called.>>> def hello(fname, repeat=5):      name_repeat = fname * repeat      return name_repeat>>> hello('james')'jamesjamesjamesjamesjames'>>> hello('james', repeat=10)'jamesjamesjamesjamesjamesjamesjamesjamesjamesjames'            Nested functionsNesting a function means to put one function into another function.>>> def hello(fname, lname):  \t  def nice(name):  \t\t  return \"alright \" + name + \" you ledge\"    return nice(fname + \" \" + lname)>>> hello('james', 'bond')'alright james bond you ledge'            Scope - LEGB ruleWhen functions start getting nested and or require data that is not within the function itself, we are going to hit problems with scope. Scope essentially means where a variable can be accessed from. Python will look within each scope in the order: local, global and then built in - abbreviated to LEGB.Local scope -created within a functionEnclosing scope -to do with nested functionsGlobal scope - created in the body of a scriptBuilt ins - i.e. the functions that are built in with Python like print() len()Global scopeWhere a variable is in the main body of the program it can be accessed from anywhere, including from within functions. In the example below, we can see the variable 'x' is created in the main body of the script and then used within the function 'add()'.>>> x = 10>>> def add(number):    \tadd_numbers = number + x    \treturn add_numbers>>> add(5)15            In the function above, the program first looked in the local scope (i.e. within the function) and then in the global scope to find the variable 'x'. We see this in the following example where 'x' is located in the local scope.>>> x = 50>>> def add(number):      x = 10      add_numbers = number + x      return add_numbers>>> add(5)15>>> x50            Local scopeAs noted above, the local scope is where a variable is accessible only from within the function. Calling the variable outside of the function will return a 'NameError'.>>> def local_variable():      y = 10      return y>>> y + 10Traceback (most recent call last):File \"pyshell#111\", line 1, in moduley + 10NameError: name 'y' is not defined            You can make a local variable global by using the keyword 'global'. This means the value now has global scope.>>> x = 50>>> def add():    \tglobal x    \tx = 10    \treturn x>>> x50>>> add()10>>> x10            Built-in scopeBuilt in is the final place Python looks when interpreting data. Typically you will not have any issues with built-in scope but on occasions you may accidentally write a function which overwrites a built-in function. Take the following example where I have named my function 'min' which subsquently means I can't use the builtin function 'min()'.    >>> lst = [1,2,3,4,5]>>> min_lst = min(lst)>>> min_lst1>>> def min():\t     pass>>> min()>>> min_lst = min(lst)Traceback (most recent call last):  File \"pyshell#151\", line 1, in     min_lst = min(lst)TypeError: min() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given>>>            Enclosing scopeEnclosing scope happens when there are nested functions; Python will first look in the local scope, if it cannot find a local variable it will look within the enclosing scope which is the within the function that it is nested. Lets look at the following example: >>> def outer():      x = 'outer x'      def inner():      \tx = 'inner x'      \tprint(x)      inner()      print(x)>>> outer()inner xouter x            Both functions have a variable named \"x\" with local scope so you see the inner and the outer printed. If we remove the inner x, the enclosed scope will be used and the inner x prints outer x as depicted below.>>> def outer():      x = 'outer x'        def inner():          print(x)      inner()      print(x)>>> outer()outer xouter x              Using the keyword 'nonlocal' allows the current scope to be passed to the enclosed scope (but not the global scope) as follows:>>> def outer():      x = 'outer x'        def inner():        nonlocal x        x = 'inner x'        print(x)      inner()      print(x)>>> outer()inner xinner x              Summary of scopeRemember python will always look for scope within the LEGB sequence (local, enclosed, global, built in). The final example shows you scope across local, enclosed and global.>>> x = 'global x'>>> def outer():    x = 'outer x'    def inner():      x = 'inner x'      print(x)      inner()    print(x)>>> outer()inner xouter x>>> x'global x'>>>              *args*args allows you to pass in an unspecified number of arguments to the function. Note, the term 'args' is not a Python keyword but a convention so it can actually be named whatever you like although its best to stick to convention. The asterisk tells python that the function accepts an undefined number of arguments.>>> def add_numbers(*args):\t\ttotal = 0\t\tfor number in args:\t\t\ttotal = total + number\t\treturn total>>> add_numbers(1,2,3)6>>> add_numbers(10,50,6)66\t\t\t\t\t\t**kargs**kwargs ,as you might have guest, are very similar to *args except they allow you to pass an undefined number of keyword arguments to the function. kwargs are a dictionary, so can be looped through and accessed using the dictionary syntax.>>> def football_player(**kwargs):\tfor key, value in kwargs.items():\t\tprint(key + \" : \" + value)>>> football_player(name='Harry Kane', club=\"Tottenham Hotspur FC\")name : Harry Kaneclub : Tottenham Hotspur FC>>> football_player(name='Harry Kane', club=\"Tottenham Hotspur FC\", position=\"Stricker\")name : Harry Kaneclub : Tottenham Hotspur FCposition : Stricker>>>\t\t\t\t\t\tLambdasLambdas allow functions to be written quickly on the fly - for this reason they should be used with caution as a normal function will often be better. To use a lambda function you must specify the 'lambda' keyword followed by the names of the variables in the function and then finally by what you would like to do with the variables and the function to return.>>> add_numbers = (lambda x, y: x * y)>>> add_numbers(5,6)30>>> add_numbers(10, 5)50\t\t\t\t\t\tNotice the syntax; first you specify the lambda keyword, then the variables and finally what should be returned.Anonymous functions (map() and lambda functions)Lambdas are most useful when they are anonymously embedded within larger expressions using 'map()'. 'map()' always you to apply a function to an object, such as a list. First you specify the keyword 'map' followed by the 'lambda' keyword and syntax (the variables and what should be returned) and lastly the object to which the function should be mapped to.>>> lst = [1,2,3,4,5]>>> square = map(lambda x: x*x, lst)>>> squaremap object at 0x03664E50>>> list(square)[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen the expression is validated it returns a map object - this can then be converted to a list using the built-in function 'list()'.filter()Using the 'filter()' function allows you to filter out data that does not satisfy a certain criteria. To use 'filter()' you first specify the 'filter' keyword, then the lambda function and lastly the object you would like to map the function to.>>> lst = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]>>> square = filter(lambda x: x > 4, lst)>>> list(square)[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\t\t\t\t\t\tUsing functions with PandasFor this final example we will count all the countries the Tottenham players originate from. First we must create the DataFrame.>>> import pandas as pd>>> players = ['Hugo Lloris', 'Kieran Trippier', 'Toby Alderweireld', 'Jan Vertonghen', 'Davinson Sanchez', 'Heung-Min Son', 'Harry Winks', 'Harry Kane', 'Erik Lamela', 'Victor Wanyama', 'Michel Vorm', 'Georges-Kévin Nkoudou', 'Eric Dier', 'Kyle Walker-Peters', 'Moussa Sissoko', 'Fernando Llorente', 'Dele Alli', 'Juan Foyth', 'Paulo Gazzaniga', 'Christian Eriksen', 'Serge Aurier', 'Josh Onomah', 'Lucas Moura', 'Ben Davies', 'Cameron Carter-Vickers', 'Vincent Janssen']>>> locations = ['Nice, France', 'Bury, England', 'Wilrijk, Belgium', 'Sint-Niklaas, Belgium', 'Caloto, Colombia', 'Chuncheon, South Korea', 'Hemel Hempstead, England', 'London, England', 'Carapachay, Argentina','Nairobi, Kenya', 'Nieuwegein, Netherlands','Versailles, France', 'Cheltenham, England', 'Edmonton, England', 'Le Blanc-Mesnil, France', 'Pamplona, Spain', 'Milton Keynes, England', 'La Plata, Argentina', 'Murphy, Argentina', 'Middelfart, Denmark', 'Ouragahio, Cote dIvoire', 'London, England', 'São Paulo, Brazil', 'Neath, Wales', 'Southend-on-Sea, England', 'Heesch, Netherlands']>>> data_combined = {'players': players, 'locations': locations}>>> tottenham_squad = pd.DataFrame(data_combined)>>> tottenham_squad                   players                 locations0              Hugo Lloris              Nice, France1          Kieran Trippier             Bury, England2        Toby Alderweireld          Wilrijk, Belgium3           Jan Vertonghen     Sint-Niklaas, Belgium4         Davinson Sanchez          Caloto, Colombia5            Heung-Min Son    Chuncheon, South Korea6              Harry Winks  Hemel Hempstead, England7               Harry Kane           London, England8              Erik Lamela     Carapachay, Argentina9           Victor Wanyama            Nairobi, Kenya10             Michel Vorm   Nieuwegein, Netherlands11   Georges-Kévin Nkoudou        Versailles, France12               Eric Dier       Cheltenham, England13      Kyle Walker-Peters         Edmonton, England14          Moussa Sissoko   Le Blanc-Mesnil, France15       Fernando Llorente           Pamplona, Spain16               Dele Alli    Milton Keynes, England17              Juan Foyth       La Plata, Argentina18         Paulo Gazzaniga         Murphy, Argentina19       Christian Eriksen       Middelfart, Denmark20            Serge Aurier   Ouragahio, Cote dIvoire21             Josh Onomah           London, England22             Lucas Moura         São Paulo, Brazil23              Ben Davies              Neath, Wales24  Cameron Carter-Vickers  Southend-on-Sea, England25         Vincent Janssen       Heesch, Netherlands\t\t\t\t\t\tNow the DataFrame is created, we create the function which accepts a DataFrame and has a default parameter for the DataFrame column set to 'locations'. The function takes the column, splits the location by ',' to only get the country from the location and adds to a dictionary to count all the occurrences of each country. Note, I also applied a try and except in case the data is in the wrong format and breaks the code.>>> def count_countries(df, col_name='locations'):    \"\"\"return all the countries and count for the tottenham first team\"\"\"    country_count = {}    countries = df[col_name]    for country in countries:        try:            country = country.split(',')[1]            if country in country_count.keys():                country_count[country] += 1            else:                country_count[country] = 1        except:            continue    return(country_count)>>> count_countries(tottenham_squad){' France': 3, ' England': 8, ' Belgium': 2, ' Colombia': 1, ' South Korea': 1, ' Argentina': 3, ' Kenya': 1, ' Netherlands': 2, ' Spain': 1, ' Denmark': 1, ' Cote dIvoire': 1, ' Brazil': 1, ' Wales': 1}>>>\t\t\t\t\t\tCode takeawayimport pandas as pd# tottenham squad dataplayers = ['Hugo Lloris', 'Kieran Trippier', 'Toby Alderweireld', 'Jan Vertonghen', 'Davinson Sanchez', 'Heung-Min Son', 'Harry Winks', 'Harry Kane', 'Erik Lamela', 'Victor Wanyama', 'Michel Vorm', 'Georges-Kévin Nkoudou', 'Eric Dier', 'Kyle Walker-Peters', 'Moussa Sissoko', 'Fernando Llorente', 'Dele Alli', 'Juan Foyth', 'Paulo Gazzaniga', 'Christian Eriksen', 'Serge Aurier', 'Josh Onomah', 'Lucas Moura', 'Ben Davies', 'Cameron Carter-Vickers', 'Vincent Janssen']locations = ['Nice, France', 'Bury, England', 'Wilrijk, Belgium', 'Sint-Niklaas, Belgium', 'Caloto, Colombia', 'Chuncheon, South Korea', 'Hemel Hempstead, England', 'London, England', 'Carapachay, Argentina','Nairobi, Kenya', 'Nieuwegein, Netherlands','Versailles, France', 'Cheltenham, England', 'Edmonton, England', 'Le Blanc-Mesnil, France', 'Pamplona, Spain', 'Milton Keynes, England', 'La Plata, Argentina', 'Murphy, Argentina', 'Middelfart, Denmark', 'Ouragahio, Cote dIvoire', 'London, England', 'São Paulo, Brazil', 'Neath, Wales', 'Southend-on-Sea, England', 'Heesch, Netherlands']# combine data within a dictionarydata_combined = {'player': players, 'location': locations}# create DataFrametottenham_squad = pd.DataFrame(data_combined)def count_countries(df, col_name='location'):    \"\"\"return all the countries and count for the tottenham first team\"\"\"    country_count = {}    countries = df[col_name]    for country in countries:        try:            country = country.split(',')[1]            if country in country_count.keys():                country_count[country] += 1            else:                country_count[country] = 1        except:            continue    return(country_count)print(count_countries(tottenham_squad))\t\t\t\t\t\tCategoriesPython programmingPython basicsPython packagesData scienceSEOSEOWeb developmentJavaScriptCSSPHPHTMLSQLPopular postsNumpy basicsMatplotlib basicsPandas basicsPandas basics- part 2Python functions overviewList, dictionary & generator comprehensionMySQL & SQL in PythonCategorising keywords at scale with NLTKSimple Python web crawler with SQLiteCrawling sites using AJAX with SeleniumSitemap  |    Learning Resources  |    Copyright © charlieojackson.co.uk 2019 |\tJS Test \n","Total links count: 34 \n","\n","Loop Counter: 27 - Crawling: https://charlieojackson.co.uk/python/list-dictionary-generator-comprehensions.php \n","Page title: List/dictionary comprehensions and generators in Python | Charlie Jackson \n","Page description: In this post we take a look at list comprehension, dictionary comprehension and generator expressions including their differences and use cases. \n","Page contents: List/dictionary comprehensions and generators in Python | Charlie JacksonCharlie JacksonAbout me            (current)PortfolioList comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions and generator expresions in Python            by            Charlie JacksonPosted on March 29, 2019 at 11:00 PMIn this tutorial we look into list comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions and generators in Python.What are comprehensionsList comprehensionsDictionary comprehensionsGenerator expressionsWhat are comprehensionsComprehensions allow you to write for loops with a single line of code to create an object like a list or dictionary. For example, say we have a list of numbers and we want to create a list of the numbers squared, we could write a for loop and append to a new list as so:>>> lst = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10]>>> squared_lst = []>>> for no in lst:       squared_no = no * no       squared_list.append(squared_no)>>> for no in lst:       squared_no = no * no       squared_lst.append(squared_no)>>> squared_lst[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 100]            Using comprehensions, or list comprehension as we are using below, as can write all the above code on a single line meaning its quicker to read and runs faster.>>> lst = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10]>>> squared_lst = [no*no for no in lst]>>> squared_lst[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 100]\t\t\t\t\t\tList comprehensionThe basic premise for list comprehension is to create a list using a single line of code. This is extremely useful when using a conditional statement within the statement - for example taking one list and creating a new list with only the data that is required. The syntax for list comprehension is ['expression output' for iterator in 'object'] as so:>>> list_of_numbers = [no for no in range(50)]>>> list_of_numbers[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]\t\t\t\t\t\tAs noted above, you can also pass conditional statements into list comprehension as a way to filter data. For example, below we have created a new list which only appends to the list if the number is divisible by 5. Note the syntax is ['expression output' for iterator in 'object' if 'condition'].>>> numbers = list(range(50))>>> numbers[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]>>> divisable_by_5 = [no for no in numbers if no % 5 == 0]>>> divisable_by_5[0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45]\t\t\t\t\t\tTo use the if/else condition, the syntax is tweaked to ['expression output' if 'condition' else '' for iterator in 'object' ].>>> numbers = list(range(50))>>> numbers[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]>>> divisable_by_5 = [no if no % 5 == 0 else 0 for no in numbers]>>> divisable_by_5[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 20, 0, 0, 0, 0, 25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 30, 0, 0, 0, 0, 35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 40, 0, 0, 0, 0, 45, 0, 0, 0, 0]\t\t\t\t\t\tLastly the returned output is flexible, so you can do things like add or subtract, apply a built-in function like 'len()' or even pass a home-made function.# using addition>>> lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10]>>> squared_lst = [no*no for no in lst]>>> squared_lst[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 100]# using a builtin function>>> names = ['charlie', 'scott', 'david', 'graihagh']>>> len_of_names= [len(name) for name in names]>>> len_of_names[7, 5, 5, 8]# using a self created function>>> def append_names(name):       full_name = name + ' jackson'       return full_name>>> full_name = [append_names(name) for name in names]>>> full_name['charlie jackson', 'scott jackson', 'david jackson', 'graihagh jackson']\t\t\t\t\t\tNested list comprehensionAs with nested for loops, you can also do nested list comprehension - as you are using two loops you typically have two output which you can do multiplication, apply a function or return as a tuple. The syntax is as so [(output1, output2) for iterator in object1 for iterator in object 2]. For example, say we have two 6-sided dice and we want to know the chances(expressed as percentage) of throwing higher than a 10.>>> possible_throws = [(throw1, throw2) for throw1 in range(1,7) for throw2 in range(1,7) if throw1 + throw2 > 10]>>> possible_throws[(5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)]>>> (len(possible_throws) / (6*6)) * 1008.333333333333332>>>\t\t\t\t\t\tDictionary comprehensionsDictionary comprehensions are much like list comprehension (except they return a dictionary), so I will not go into the same amount of detail other than syntax. The main difference is you use a curly braces {} instead of square brackets [] and you must specify the 'key' and 'value'; the syntax being {'key' : 'value' for 'iterator' in 'object'}. Conditional logic follows the same syntax and logic as list comprehension.>>> names = ['charlie', 'scott', 'david', 'graihagh']>>> names_dict = {name : len(name) for name in names}>>> names_dict{'charlie': 7, 'scott': 5, 'david': 5, 'graihagh': 8}\t\t\t\t\t\tGenerator expressionsGenerators are closely related to list and dictionary comprehension but the big difference is that a generator expression returns a generator object. Where lists and dictionaries are stored in memory, generator objects are not -they are generated on the fly when they are needed. This is also known as lazy evaluation. The syntax for generator expressions is similar to that of list and dictionaries except this time we use brackets (). (expressions output for iterator in object).Do not run this code at home. In the example below we can look at creating list comprehension versus a generator. As the list is stored in memory, the list we have created is soo large it will crash a computer. However, with our generator it is being created on the fly so it has no problem with the statement and returns a generator object when called.# list comprehension - do not run>>> # large_number = [num for num in range(10 ** 10000)]# generator expression>>> large_list = (num for num in range(10 ** 10000))>>> large_list = (num for num in range(10 ** 10000))>>> large_listgenerator object genexpr at 0x03C193F0>>> for no in large_list:       if no > 5:          break       print(no)012345\t\t\t\t\t\tCategoriesPython programmingPython basicsPython packagesData scienceSEOSEOWeb developmentJavaScriptCSSPHPHTMLSQLPopular postsNumpy basicsMatplotlib basicsPandas basicsPandas basics- part 2Python functions overviewList, dictionary & generator comprehensionMySQL & SQL in PythonCategorising keywords at scale with NLTKSimple Python web crawler with SQLiteCrawling sites using AJAX with SeleniumSitemap  |    Learning Resources  |    Copyright © charlieojackson.co.uk 2019 |\tJS Test \n","Total links count: 30 \n","\n","Loop Counter: 28 - Crawling: https://charlieojackson.co.uk/python/sqlite-mysql-with-python.php \n","Page title: SQLite & MySQL with Python | Charlie Jackson \n","Page description: In this post we'll take a look at using Python with SQL - more specifically a SQLite datebase and MySQL to do simple CRUD functions. \n","Page contents: SQLite & MySQL with Python | Charlie JacksonCharlie JacksonAbout me            (current)PortfolioSQLite and MySQL with Python            by            Charlie JacksonPosted on April 12, 2019 at 19:00 PMIn this tutorial we'll be going through the basics of using Python with an SQLite database as well as MySQL. We'll be hosting the MySQL database locally so if you'd like to follow along you can download XAMP. For SQLite we'll be using a DB viewer for SQLite so again download if required. I also have a previous tutorial on SQL basics with SQLite.Databases using SQLite and PythonSQLite insert statementSQLite select statementSQLite update statementSQLite delete statementDatabases using MySQL and PythonMySQL insert statementMySQL select statementMySQL update statementMySQL delete statementDatabases using SQLite and PythonSQLite comes pre-installed with Python so we simply need to import the 'sqlite3' package at the top of your Python script and we can start using it. After importing we must connect to our SQLite database - this is a case calling the sqlite3 method 'connect' as well as creating a 'cursor' object. Note, when we connect to the specified database if will first look for an existing file and if it cannot find an existing database it will create a new database. We can do some simple 'insert' statements - in the example I have stored in a list and looped through. Finally we commit the executions so everything is saved.import sqlite3try:    # connect to database    db = sqlite3.connect('example_db.db')    cursor = db.cursor()    # Create database    cursor.execute(\"\"\"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Persons (PersonID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,FirstName varchar(255),LastName varchar(255));\"\"\")    # Insert data into database    sql_statements = [\"INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName,LastName) VALUES ('Charlie','Jackson');\", \"INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName,LastName) VALUES ('Scott','Jackson');\", \"INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName,LastName) VALUES ('Dave','Jackson');\",\"INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName,LastName) VALUES ('Audrey','Plastiras');\",\"INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName,LastName) VALUES ('Nikki','Plastiras');\",\"INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName,LastName) VALUES ('Dave','Plastiras');\",\"INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName,LastName) VALUES ('Grace','Plastiras');\"]    for statement in sql_statements:        print(statement)        cursor.execute(statement)    db.commit()except Exception as e:    print(\"Connection failed: \", e)\t\t\t\tSQLite insert statementTo pass in a variable into your SQL statement use the '?' as a placeholder. For this example I have created a function which accepts a user in the form of a tuple (first name and last name). Now we can simply call the 'InsertUser' function with a tuple of first name and last name to add new users. Alternatively, you do the run the same code in oneline which is commented out.def InsertUser(User):    SQL_Insert = \"\"\"INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName,LastName) VALUES (?,?)\"\"\"    cursor.execute(SQL_Insert, User)    #cursor.execute(\"INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName,LastName) VALUES (?,?)\", (User[0],User[1],))    print(User[0] + \" \" + User[1] + \" inserted into database\")InsertUser(('Graihagh', 'Jackson')) # note we have passed in a tupleInsertUser(('Heath', 'Jackson'))\t\t\t\tSQL select statementTo run a select statement we follow a similar process - we include create a function with one parameter which accepts a last name. We then pass the 'LastName' into the executable SQL statement, fetch all the results and return them.

Again, I have wrapped this all into a function which accepts the first name. Note this is not very dynamic i.e. it always changes the last name to 'Jackson' but for the purpose of showing the basics in Python it does the trick.def UpdateUser(FirstName):    cursor.execute(\"UPDATE Persons SET LastName = 'Jackson' WHERE FirstName = ?;\", (FirstName,))    print(FirstName + \" user profile updated\")UpdateUser('Audrey')\t\t\t\tSQL delete statementdef DeleteUsers(LastName):    cursor.execute(\"DELETE FROM Persons WHERE LastName = ?;\", (LastName,))    print(LastName + \" deleted from table\")DeleteUsers('Jackson')\t\t\t\tSQLite code takeawayThis code can be saved in a python file (.py) and executed in the terminal.import sqlite3def InsertUser(User):    \"\"\"Insert new users\"\"\"    SQL_Insert = \"\"\"INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName,LastName) VALUES (?,?)\"\"\"    cursor.execute(SQL_Insert, User)    #cursor.execute(\"INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName,LastName) VALUES (?,?)\", (User[0],User[1],))    print(User[0] + \" \" + User[1] + \" inserted into database\")def SelectUserLastName(LastName):    \"\"\"Select users based upon last name.

We're also using 'mysql.connector' package which needs to be installed - this can be down via pip:pip install mysql-connector-python\t\t\t\tOnce XAMP is installed, head over to the 'https://localhost' in your web browser and then to the tab 'phpMyAdmin'. From here we are going to create an example database - use the 'SQL' tab enter the SQL below and hit 'go'.CREATE DATABASE example_db;\t\t\t\tNow we have a working database, we'll make our connection using 'mysql.connector'. To connect we'll have to provide a host, some login details and the database. As we are using XAMP, the hostname is 'locahost', we'll use the default log in details which are 'root' for the username and nothing for the password. Finally we'll use the database we've just created named 'example_db'. If that all connects, then we create a new table which has 3 columns - an ID ,first name and a last name.hostname = 'localhost'username = 'root'password = ''database = 'example_db'import mysql.connectortry:    myConnection = mysql.connector.connect(host=hostname, user=username, passwd=password, db=database)    cursor = myConnection.cursor()    # Create database    cursor.execute(\"\"\"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Persons (Personid int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,FirstName varchar(255),LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,PRIMARY KEY (Personid));\"\"\")\t\tmyConnection.commit()    myConnection.close()except Exception as e:    print(\"Failed: \" + str(e))\t\t\t\tThe CRUD functionality between SQLite and MySQL is marginal so for the remaining examples I have provided the code which is near identical.MySQL insert statementAs with the SQLite example before, we create a function which accepts a user (in our case we pass a tuple with a first and last name). The only difference this time is instead of a '?' which use '%s' to pass variables into the SQL statement.def InsertUser(User):    SQL_Statement = \"INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName,LastName) VALUES (%s, %s)\"    cursor.execute(SQL_Statement, (User[0],User[1],))    print(User[0] + \" \" + User[1] + \" inserted into database\")InsertUser(('Graihagh', 'Jackson')) # note we have passed in a tupleInsertUser(('Heath', 'Jackson'))\t\t\t\tMySQL select statementdef SelectUserLastName(LastName):    SQL_Statement = \"SELECT * FROM Persons WHERE Lastname = %s\"    cursor.execute(SQL_Statement, (LastName,))    Users = cursor.fetchall()    return UsersSelectUserLastName('Jackson')\t\t\t\tMySQL update statementdef UpdateUser(FirstName):    SQL_Statement = \"UPDATE Persons SET LastName = 'Alcock' WHERE FirstName = %s;\"    cursor.execute(SQL_Statement, (FirstName,))    print(FirstName + \" user profile updated\")UpdateUser('Heath')\t\t\t\tMySQL delete statementdef DeleteUsers(LastName):    SQL_Statement = \"DELETE FROM Persons WHERE LastName = %s;\"    cursor.execute(SQL_Statement, (LastName,))    print(LastName + \" deleted from table\")DeleteUsers('Jackson')\t\t\t\t MySQL code takeawayhostname = 'localhost'username = 'root'password = ''database = 'example_db'import mysql.connectordef InsertUser(User):    SQL_Statement = \"INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName,LastName) VALUES (%s, %s)\"    cursor.execute(SQL_Statement, (User[0],User[1],))    print(User[0] + \" \" + User[1] + \" inserted into database\")def SelectUserLastName(LastName):    SQL_Statement = \"SELECT * FROM Persons WHERE Lastname = %s\"    cursor.execute(SQL_Statement, (LastName,))    Users = cursor.fetchall()    return Usersdef UpdateUser(FirstName):    SQL_Statement = \"UPDATE Persons SET LastName = 'Alcock' WHERE FirstName = %s;\"    cursor.execute(SQL_Statement, (FirstName,))    print(FirstName + \" user profile updated\")def DeleteUsers(LastName):    SQL_Statement = \"DELETE FROM Persons WHERE LastName = %s;\"    cursor.execute(SQL_Statement, (LastName,))    print(LastName + \" deleted from table\")try:    myConnection = mysql.connector.connect(host=hostname, user=username, passwd=password, db=database)    cursor = myConnection.cursor()    # Create database    cursor.execute(\"\"\"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Persons (Personid int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,FirstName varchar(255),LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,PRIMARY KEY (Personid));\"\"\")    InsertUser(('Graihagh', 'Jackson')) # note we have passed in a tuple    InsertUser(('Heath', 'Jackson'))    SelectUserLastName('Jackson')    UpdateUser('Heath')    DeleteUsers('Jackson')    myConnection.commit()    myConnection.close()except Exception as e:    print(\"Failed: \" + str(e))\t\t\t\tCategoriesPython programmingPython basicsPython packagesData scienceSEOSEOWeb developmentJavaScriptCSSPHPHTMLSQLPopular postsNumpy basicsMatplotlib basicsPandas basicsPandas basics- part 2Python functions overviewList, dictionary & generator comprehensionMySQL & SQL in PythonCategorising keywords at scale with NLTKSimple Python web crawler with SQLiteCrawling sites using AJAX with SeleniumSitemap  |    Learning Resources  |    Copyright © charlieojackson.co.uk 2019 |\tJS Test \n","Total links count: 40 \n","\n","Loop Counter: 29 - Crawling: https://charlieojackson.co.uk/python/catergorising-keywords-at-scale.php \n","Page title: Categorising keywords at scale using Python, Pandas and NLTK | Charlie Jackson \n","Page description: In this post we look at how we can use NLTK to categorise keywords at scale. \n","Page contents: Categorising keywords at scale using Python, Pandas and NLTK | Charlie JacksonCharlie JacksonAbout me            (current)PortfolioCategorising keywords at scale using Python,Pandas and NLTK            by            Charlie JacksonPosted on April 12, 2019 at 19:00 PMAnyone that has had to keyword research before will know about the hours upon hours you spend categorising your data after you've collected it. Fortunately, there are a few nifty ways to speed up this process using natural language processing. There are many tools out there - perhaps most notably Google's natural language tool. For this tutorial we'll be looking at a Python Package known as NLTK.InstallsKeyword data setCategorising keywords with NLTKReading CSV to Pandas DataFrameFinding the noun, adjective and verb within keywordsApplying functions to DataFrameGraphing the dataFinal thoughtsCode takeawayInstallsFor the script we'll be using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib (to plot some distributions of the most common keywords for our data set), NLTK and Pickle. Below shows the command to pip install.pip install pandaspip install numpypip install matplotlibpip install nltkpip install pickle\t\t\t\tAs we'll be using all these packages, you should import them at the top of your Python script with the conventions provided.import pandas as pdimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport nltkfrom nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize, word_tokenizeimport pickle\t\t\t\tKeyword data setBefore we can categorise our keywords we need a data set! If you've actually produced some keyword research you can use this. Alternatively, if you have access to a tool like SEMrush or Search Metrics you can pull keywords from there - for my example I have pulled 50,000 keywords from SEMrush for https://www.ebay.co.uk/. Save the file as a CSV as we'll be reading a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame. I have taken a screenshot of the CSV keyword data set I have from SEMrush - note, you do not need all the extra columns just the 'Keyword' column containing all your keywords.Categorising keywords with NLTKReading CSV to Pandas DataFrameFirst thing we need to do is read the keyword data CSV into a DataFrame using the Pandas method 'read_csv()'. You can check this has worked as planned by printing a snippet of the dataframe using the Pandas method '.head()'df = pd.read_csv('keyword_data.csv')print(df.head())\t\t\t\tFinding the noun, adjective and verb within keywordsNow we have a DataFrame with our keywords, we need a way to categorise them. The approach will be to write three functions to find the noun, adjective and verb from each keyword (or row from the DataFrame) and then apply these functions to the DataFrame. Firstly though we will write the functions. Each function will take a keyword, which will be 'tokenized' and then labelled. The process of 'tokenization' basically takes a string and splits it into a list of words. The labelling basically means tagging each word with its part of speech i.e. is it a noun, adjective, verb or something else?For example in the code below, we take a simple string, tokenize it and then label the keywords. Note, you'll need to import NLTK as noted above for this to work.>>> sentence = \"the scared cat ran across the road\">>> tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence)>>> tokens['the', 'scared', 'cat', 'ran', 'across', 'the', 'road']>>> tagged = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)>>> tagged[('the', 'DT'), ('scared', 'JJ'), ('cat', 'NN'), ('ran', 'VBD'), ('across', 'IN'), ('the', 'DT'), ('road', 'NN')]\t\t\t\tNotice how the tagged returns a list of tuples and the labels are acronyms - 'NN' is a noun, 'VB' is a verb and 'JJ' is an adjective.Returning to our original goal, we'll now write a function. The function will take a keyword, tokenize the keyword and label its part of speech. We're only interested in certain words to categories like the noun so we'll only keep what is relevant. To do this we'll use list comprehension and create a list only when we find a relevant part of speach. Lastly we'll return the first keyword (as we do not want to return multiple nouns/adjectives/verbs for each keyword). I have written a function to return the noun, adjective and verb.def find_noun(keyword):    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(keyword)    tagged = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)    noun = [w for w,t in tagged if \"NN\" in t]    if len(noun) < 1:        return \"\"    else:        return noun[0]def find_verb(keyword):    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(keyword)    tagged = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)    verb = [w for w,t in tagged if \"VB\" in t]    if len(verb) < 1:        return \"\"    else:        return verb[0]def find_adjective(keyword):    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(keyword)    tagged = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)    adjective = [w for w,t in tagged if \"JJ\" in t]    if len(adjective) < 1:        return \"\"    else:        return adjective[0]\t\t\t\tApplying functions to DataFrameWe now have our keyword data set stored as a Pandas DataFrame and three functions to identify the noun, adjective and verb for each keyword - we simply need to apply each function to each keyword. To do this, we create a new column (which will be the keyword categorised as either a noun, adjective or verb) and 'apply' our function to the keyword row in the Dataframe.df['Noun'] = df['Keyword'].apply(find_noun)df['Verb'] = df['Keyword'].apply(find_verb)df['Adjective'] = df['Keyword'].apply(find_adjective)\t\t\t\tIf you print the head of the DataFrame using '.head()' method you'll see the DataFrame has three new columns (for the noun, adjective and verb) and has extracted each part of speech into the column where applicable.You can now save the DataFrame back to CSV to see the whole data set with its new categories. I also pickle the data so we can use it again for graphing.df.to_csv('keywords_catorised.csv')df.to_pickle('keywords_categorised_pickle')\t\t\t\tThe categorising can take a while (it took me approximately 3-4 mins to categorise 50,000 keywords) so its best to save the data once complete in the form of a pickle. In following section will take the pickle and graph some of the new categorised data.Graphing the data using MatplotlibAs we have saved all the data up until this point, I've added a try/except clause - if the data has been saved as a pickle we use that, otherwise it will run the categorisation from scratch.try:    df = pd.read_pickle('keywords_categorised_pickle')except Exception as e:    print(\"Unable to load pickle, reading from file keyword_data.csv file...\")    df = pd.read_csv('keyword_data.csv')    df['Noun'] = df['Keyword'].apply(find_noun)    df['Verb'] = df['Keyword'].apply(find_verb)    df['Adjective'] = df['Keyword'].apply(find_adjective)    df.to_pickle('keywords_categorised_pickle')\t\t\t\tNow onto the graphing. The aim of the graph here is to give a top level view of what categories are most prominent in the data set, i.e. what is the most common noun, adjective or verb. As I have ranking data for eBay I can immediately see what keywords they rank well for which is valuable to competitors.To graph this data, we call the 'value_counts()' method on each category columns. As there are likely thousands of different categories we take a tiny proportion by slicing - in this case I have taken the top 20 categories and store in a new variable. We then plot the data using 'plt.plot()' and pass in our variable holding the data. I have done this for the noun, adjective and verb columns.noun = df['Noun'].value_counts()[:20]plt.plot(noun)plt.xlabel('Keyword')plt.ylabel('Count')plt.title('Count of ranking noun keywords')plt.xticks(rotation='vertical')plt.show()adjective = df['Adjective'].value_counts()[1:20]plt.plot(adjective)plt.xlabel('Keyword')plt.ylabel('Count')plt.title('Count of ranking adjective keywords')plt.xticks(rotation='vertical')plt.show()verb = df['Verb'].value_counts()[1:20]plt.plot(verb)plt.xlabel('Keyword')plt.ylabel('Count')plt.title('Count of ranking verb keywords')plt.xticks(rotation='vertical')plt.show()\t\t\t\tFinal thoughtsThe aim of this post was to give an overview of how you could categorise keywords at scale. It is by no means perfect. There are lots of errors - NLTK is not perfect at finding nouns, adjectives and verbs so often it returns 'noise'. There is also the problem with words having multiple meanings and words being synonymous with one another. It can't, for example, tell you what landing pages you should build based upon the keyword data. It is a building block though, and with some tinkering if could be much improved. Where I see the value is looking at competitors rankings very quickly i.e. a competitor site like Gumtree would be interested in their rankings versus eBays to find out where there are opportunities to gain organic traffic.Code takeawayThis code can be used in a python script and run in the command line.import pandas as pdimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport nltkfrom nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize, word_tokenizeimport pickledef find_noun(keyword):    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(keyword)    tagged = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)    noun = [w for w,t in tagged if \"NN\" in t]    if len(noun) < 1:        return \"None\"    else:        return noun[0]def find_verb(keyword):    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(keyword)    tagged = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)    verb = [w for w,t in tagged if \"VB\" in t]    if len(verb) < 1:        return \"\"    else:        return verb[0]def find_adjective(keyword):    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(keyword)    tagged = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)    adjective = [w for w,t in tagged if \"JJ\" in t]    if len(adjective) < 1:        return \"\"    else:        return adjective[0]saved_address = 'keywords_categorised_pickle'try:    df = pd.read_pickle(saved_address)except Exception as e:    print(\"Unable to load pickle, reading from file keyword_data.csv file... this could take 10mins plus\")    df = pd.read_csv('keyword_data.csv')    df['Noun'] = df['Keyword'].apply(find_noun)    df['Verb'] = df['Keyword'].apply(find_verb)    df['Adjective'] = df['Keyword'].apply(find_adjective)    df.to_pickle(saved_address)noun = df['Noun'].value_counts()[:20]plt.plot(noun)plt.xlabel('Keyword')plt.ylabel('Count')plt.title('Count of ranking noun keywords')plt.xticks(rotation='vertical')plt.show()adjective = df['Adjective'].value_counts()[1:20]plt.plot(adjective)plt.xlabel('Keyword')plt.ylabel('Count')plt.title('Count of ranking adjective keywords')plt.xticks(rotation='vertical')plt.show()verb = df['Verb'].value_counts()[1:20]plt.plot(verb)plt.xlabel('Keyword')plt.ylabel('Count')plt.title('Count of ranking verb keywords')plt.xticks(rotation='vertical')plt.show()df.to_csv('keywords_catorised.csv')\t\t\t\tCategoriesPython programmingPython basicsPython packagesData scienceSEOSEOWeb developmentJavaScriptCSSPHPHTMLSQLPopular postsNumpy basicsMatplotlib basicsPandas basicsPandas basics- part 2Python functions overviewList, dictionary & generator comprehensionMySQL & SQL in PythonCategorising keywords at scale with NLTKSimple Python web crawler with SQLiteCrawling sites using AJAX with SeleniumSitemap  |    Learning Resources  |    Copyright © charlieojackson.co.uk 2019 |\tJS Test \n","Total links count: 37 \n","\n","Loop Counter: 30 -

In this tutorial we'll look at the basics for importing files with the NumPy and Pandas packages.InstallsReading a text fileReading a CSV in NumPyReading a CSV in PandasReading an Excel file in PandasInstallsThe three packages we be will using are Pandas,NumPy and Matplotlib which do not come preinstalled with Python. These can be installed using pip.pip install pandaspip install numPypip install matplotlib\t\t\t\tReading a text fileTo read a text file in Python you simply pass the file path to the built in function 'open' with the 'r' parameter which stands for r (you can also use 'w' or 'a' to write or append to a file respectively) and store as a variable. You can then iterate through the file or read in a one go - note for larger files its wise to iterate through. Once you are finished with your file, you must close the file.>>> file = open('made_up_text.txt', 'r')>>> file.read()'the cat ran across the road\\nthe dog ran across the road after the cat\\n'>>> file.close()\t\t\t\tTo iterate through the file, you simply use a for loop.>>> file = open('made_up_text.txt', 'r')>>> for line in file:\tprint(line)the cat ran across the roadthe dog ran across the road after the cat>>> file.close()\t\t\t\tLastly, you'll see many instances of code which opens a file, does something with the contents and immediately closes once complete.>>> with open('made_up_text.txt', 'r') as file:\tprint(file.read())the cat ran across the roadthe dog ran across the road after the cat\t\t\t\tReading a CSV into NumPyTo read a CSV file with NumPy you can use the NumPy function 'loadtxt()'. You pass the file name into the parameter - on this occasion we have also passed the 'skiprows' parameter as the opening row is a column header which is a string.>>> file = np.loadtxt('made_up_numbers.csv',skiprows=1)>>> filearray([  1.,  43.,  63.,  18.,  32.,  34.,  65.,  21.,  36.,  22.,  63.,        62.,  91.,  82.,  23.,  30.,  70.,  24.,  93.,  15.,  28.,  71.,        22.,   7.,  46.,  21.,  87.,  99.,  35.,   8.,  69.,  15.,  36.,        37.,  39.,  96.,  42.,  66.,  52.,  57.,  84.,  44.,  21.,  89.,        77.,  22.,  96.,  38.,  44.,  12.,  35.,  42.,  12.,  74.,  31.,         3.,  60.,  48.,  73.,  72.,  10.,  77.,  30.,  91.,  60.,  15.,        25.,  34.,  64.,  52.,  81.,  78.,  74.,   9.,  44.,  74.,  88.,        90.,  71.,  68.,  44.,  43.,  83., 100.,  92.,  64.,  84.,  58.,         5.,  13.,  59.,  13.,  28.,  43.,  89.,  12.,  67.,  97.,  37.])>>> file.sum(file)>>> np.sum(file)4964.0\t\t\t\tThe CSV above only has one column, but you can also pass in CSV files with multiple columns. In the example below, you must pass how the file is delimited (CSV, standing for 'comma-separated values', is delimited by commas) - this is often by a comma, but can be a tab or another symbol.>>> file = np.loadtxt('made_up_numbers2.csv', delimiter=',', skiprows=1)>>> file.shape(99, 2)\t\t\t\tReading a CSV into PandasSimilarly to importing data in NumPy, Pandas has a similar function to read CSVs - 'read_csv'. In the example below I have taken a download of data from Kaggle about Fifa19's footballer players and respective KPI's.>>> df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')>>> df.head()   Unnamed: 0      ID       ...       GKReflexes  Release Clause0           0  158023       ...                8         €226.5M1           1   20801       ...               11         €127.1M2           2  190871       ...               11         €228.1M3           3  193080       ...               94         €138.6M4           4  192985       ...               13         €196.4M[5 rows x 89 columns]>>> df.columnsIndex(['Unnamed: 0', 'ID', 'Name', 'Age', 'Photo', 'Nationality', 'Flag',       'Overall', 'Potential', 'Club', 'Club Logo', 'Value', 'Wage', 'Special',       'Preferred Foot', 'International Reputation', 'Weak Foot',       'Skill Moves', 'Work Rate', 'Body Type', 'Real Face', 'Position',       'Jersey Number', 'Joined', 'Loaned From', 'Contract Valid Until',       'Height', 'Weight', 'LS', 'ST', 'RS', 'LW', 'LF', 'CF', 'RF', 'RW',       'LAM', 'CAM', 'RAM', 'LM', 'LCM', 'CM', 'RCM', 'RM', 'LWB', 'LDM',       'CDM', 'RDM', 'RWB', 'LB', 'LCB', 'CB', 'RCB', 'RB', 'Crossing',       'Finishing', 'HeadingAccuracy', 'ShortPassing', 'Volleys', 'Dribbling',       'Curve', 'FKAccuracy', 'LongPassing', 'BallControl', 'Acceleration',       'SprintSpeed', 'Agility', 'Reactions', 'Balance', 'ShotPower',       'Jumping', 'Stamina', 'Strength', 'LongShots', 'Aggression',       'Interceptions', 'Positioning', 'Vision', 'Penalties', 'Composure',       'Marking', 'StandingTackle', 'SlidingTackle', 'GKDiving', 'GKHandling',       'GKKicking', 'GKPositioning', 'GKReflexes', 'Release Clause'],      dtype='object')\t\t\t We can subsequently pass data from the Pandas DataFrame into a NumPy array to perform some basic statistical analysis. For example, we can compare the average age of goal keepers and strikers.>>> avg_age_keeper = df[df['Position'] == 'GK'] # returns a DataFrame>>> np.mean(avg_age_keeper['Age']) # passes a data series to NumPy28.973214285714285>>> avg_age_striker = df[df['Position'] == 'ST']>>> np.mean(avg_age_striker['Age'])28.27173913043478\t\t\t Interestingly, it appears goal keepers on average are only marginally older than strikers (on Fifa). Note the code above can be written on a single line as so: >>> avg_age_keeper = np.mean(df.loc[df['Position'] == 'GK','Age']) >>> avg_age_keeper 28.973214285714285>>> avg_age_striker = np.mean(df.loc[df['Position'] == 'ST','Age'])>>> avg_age_striker28.27173913043478\t\t\t Lastly we can plot the distributions on a histogram.# plot average age of keepers>>> pd.DataFrame.hist(avg_age_keeper[['Age']])>>> plt.xlabel('Age')>>> plt.ylabel('Count')>>> plt.title('Average age of keepers on Fifa')>>> plt.show()# plot average age of strikers>>> pd.DataFrame.hist(avg_age_striker[['Age']])>>> plt.xlabel('Age')>>> plt.ylabel('Count')>>> plt.title('Average age of strikers on Fifa')>>> plt.show()\t\t\t Reading an Excel file to PandasReading an Excel file is very similar to a CSV - you use the pandas function 'ExcelFile()'. Subsequently you can pass which sheet you would like to read into the DataFrame. Note, you may need to install 'xlrd' via pip - 'pip install xlrd'.>>> df = pd.ExcelFile('data.xlsx')['data', 'another sheet']>>> df = df.parse('data')>>> df.head()       ID               Name      ...

If you throw a heads, you take two steps up - conversely, if you throw a tails you take one step down. Lastly,  you're a bit clumsy so there’s a 7% chance you drop the coin and in that case you must go down 5 steps. You can never go below the bottom step. On what step would you be after 1000 coin tosses?There are two ways to solve this problem - you could solve mathematically with probability, or alternatively you can simulate the games. In this example, we are going to simulate the game many times over to get a distribution of results which we can plot.InstallsThe three packages we be will using are Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib which do not come preinstalled with Python. These can be installed using pip.pip install pandaspip install NumPypip install matplotlib\t\t\t\tFor all the preceding code, you will need to import the respective packages below. You can import with or without conventions although its typically recommended you use conventions so others can understand your code.>>> import NumPy as np>>> import pandas as pd>>>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\t\t\t\tSimulating the coin toss and traveling up the stairsThe first thing I have done is set the seed - this means the random numbers are predictable so everyone will get the same results. Then the random walk is initialised as a list, with the first step being zero. We now define how many times we will toss the coin, and use a for loop to simulate the flipping of the coin. Using np.random.randint() we return either 0 or 1 representing heads of tails with equal probability. Finally, we take the previous step and add to the current step (depending upon the result of the coin) and append to the list and plot the list (which represents travelling up the stairs).>>> np.random.seed(123)>>> random_walk = [0]>>> coin_tosses = 1000>>> for flip in range(coin_tosses):    coin = np.random.randint(0,2)    step = random_walk[flip]    if coin == 1:        step = step + 2    else:        step = max(0, step - 1) # this stops the step from going below 0 on the bottom step    random_walk.append(step)>>> plt.plot(random_walk)>>> plt.show()\t\t\t\tThe graph below shows the results of 1000 coin tosses and progress up the stairs. Its fairly predictable that 1000 coin tosses gets you close to 500 steps.Play the game 10 timesFollowing on from the previous code block, we create a range of games, loop through each game and create a list which contains the results of each unique random walk. We then convert this into a NumPy array, transpose the data (otherwise the graph is hard to interpret) and plot and show the graph.>>> coin_tosses = 1000>>> no_of_games = 10>>> all_walks = []>>> for game in range(no_of_games):    # create a list for steps    random_walk = [0]    for flip in range(coin_tosses):        coin = np.random.randint(0,2)        step = random_walk[flip]        if coin == 1:            step = step + 2        else:            step = max(0, step - 1) # this stops the step from going below        random_walk.append(step)    all_walks.append(random_walk)>>> np_walks = np.array(all_walks)>>> np_walks_transpose = np.transpose(np_walks)>>> plt.plot(np_walks_transpose)>>> plt.show()\t\t\t\tThe graph below shows the results of 10 games, each line being a unique game. Now you can see we have a bit of a distribution of results, with some players closer to 400 and others closer to 600.Factoring clumsinessRemember, we stated in the game that there is a 7% chance of dropping the coin which means we must go down five steps - we will now factor this in. We simply generate another number between 0-1 and if the number is less than or equal to 7% (0.07) then we take 5 steps down.>>> coin_tosses = 1000>>> no_of_games = 10>>> all_walks = []>>> for game in range(no_of_games):    # create a list for steps    random_walk = [0]    for flip in range(coin_tosses):        coin = np.random.randint(0,2)        step = random_walk[flip]        if coin == 1:            step = step + 2        else:            step = max(0, step - 1) # this stops the step from going below        if np.random.rand() <= 0.07:            step = max(0, step - 5)        random_walk.append(step)    all_walks.append(random_walk)>>> np_walks = np.array(all_walks)>>> np_walks_transpose = np.transpose(np_walks)>>> plt.plot(np_walks_transpose)>>> plt.show()\t\t\t\tThe graph below shows 10 games factoring clumsiness. Note how the distribution is getting larger.Plotting the distributionFollowing on from the previous code - now we have results of 10 games. If we take the final result of each game, we can see what step every player ended up on after 1000 coin tosses. For this final example, we are going to up the simulation to 10,000 players. Note, this can take a bit longer to run especially on old machines. To get the final result of each game we simply slice the NumPy array and plot onto a histogram.>>> coin_tosses = 1000>>> no_of_games = 10000>>> all_walks = []>>> for game in range(no_of_games):    # create a list for steps    random_walk = [0]    for flip in range(coin_tosses):        coin = np.random.randint(0,2)        step = random_walk[flip]        if coin == 1:            step = step + 2        else:            step = max(0, step - 1) # this stops the step from going below        if np.random.rand() <= 0.07:            step = max(0, step - 5)        random_walk.append(step)    all_walks.append(random_walk)>>> np_walks = np.array(all_walks)>>> np_walks_transpose = np.transpose(np_walks)>>> ends = np_walks_transpose[-1]>>> plt.plot(ends)>>> plt.show()\t\t\t\tThe histogram below shows the distribution of 10,000 players final step (or step height) after 1000 coin tosses using the rules stated.Don't forget using NumPy you can look at simply statistics, like the mean, mode standard deviation etc by calling their respective methods.>>> ends.max()218>>> ends.min()50>>> ends.mean()158.5>>> ends.std()44.815733844265004\t\t\t\tCode takeawayThis code can be added to a python file (.py) and run in the terminal.import NumPy as npimport pandas as pdimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltnp.random.seed(123) # this means we get the same results everytime# number of coin tossescoin_tosses = 1000no_of_games = 10000all_walks = []for game in range(no_of_games):    # create a list for steps    random_walk = [0]    for flip in range(coin_tosses):        coin = np.random.randint(0,2)        step = random_walk[flip]        if coin == 1:            step = step + 2        else:            step = max(0, step - 1) # this stops the step from going below        if np.random.rand() <= 0.07:            step = max(0, step - 5)        random_walk.append(step)    all_walks.append(random_walk)np_walks = np.array(all_walks)np_walks_transpose = np.transpose(np_walks)ends = np_walks_transpose[-1]plt.hist(ends)plt.show()\t\t\t\tCategoriesPython programmingPython basicsPython packagesData scienceSEOSEOWeb developmentJavaScriptCSSPHPHTMLSQLPopular postsNumpy basicsMatplotlib basicsPandas basicsPandas basics- part 2Python functions overviewList, dictionary & generator comprehensionMySQL & SQL in PythonCategorising keywords at scale with NLTKSimple Python web crawler with SQLiteCrawling sites using AJAX with SeleniumSitemap  |    Learning Resources  |    Copyright © charlieojackson.co.uk 2019 |\tJS Test \n","Total links count: 35 \n","\n","Loop Counter: 73 - Crawling: https://charlieojackson.co.uk/?search=numpy \n","Page title: Charlie Jackson | Blogging about Python programming, SEO and web development \n","Page description: The blog of Charlie Jackson; SEO, Python programming, web development tutorials and code examples. \n","Page contents: Charlie Jackson | Blogging about Python programming, SEO and web developmentCharlie JacksonAbout me            (current)PortfolioSEO, Python programming and web developmentThe random walk challengeData science involves using a number of packages in conjuction with one another - in this tutorial we dive into a well known example called the \"the randon walk\" in which we using a number of core data science packages.Read More → Posted: 21-03-2019 Tagged: pandas, data science, numpy, matplotlib,  random walkNumpy basicsIn this post we look at the very basic features of the NumPy package in Python.

For example, say you are an accountant and you must work out how much to pay each member of staff based upon their hourly wage and the numbers of hours they've worked. Done manually this would take some time (depending upon how many staff you had) - you could, however, write a function that would do this repetitive task for you.To write a function, you start by using the JS keyword 'function' then provide a name for your function, follow with parentheses, brackets and then your logic for you function.function two_plus_two()\t{\treturn 2+2;\t}console.log(two_plus_two()); # returns 4        Note that we used the JS keyword 'return' to pass the result back the call. In this case we just logged it to the console, but you could also assign it to a variable.Functions with parametersTo make functions more dynamic, you can add parameters which allows you to pass data into the function. Using our earlier example we can forecast a staff members pay by creating a function which accepts an hourly wage and number of hours.function staff_pay(hours_worked, hourly_pay)\t{\treturn hourly_pay * hours_worked;\t}console.log(staff_pay(40, 10)); # returns 400let Jamie = staff_pay(40, 10);console.log(Jamie); # returns 400\t\t\t\tNote how created a variable 'Jamie' and assign to it the returned value from the function call. We can also provide a default parameter - this means if we do not pass any data to the function, it will use the default. For example, say 90% of staff are on the same hourly wage you could use a default value for this and specify a wage when an employee has a unique hourly wage.function staff_pay(hours_worked, hourly_pay=10)\t{\treturn hourly_pay * hours_worked;\t}console.log(staff_pay(40)); # returns 400let Jamie = staff_pay(40, 15);console.log(Jamie); # returns 600\t\t\t\tJS keyword 'return'When a function is executed and hits a 'return' keyword, anything after the return will not be executed. In some cases you might want to have multiple returns using conditional logic. For example, say any staff member that works over 40 hours per week receives pay and a half for the overtime hours, otherwise they receive their normally hourly wage.function staff_pay(hours_worked, hourly_pay)\t{\tif (hours_worked > 40)\t\t{\t\tlet standard_pay = 40 * hourly_pay;\t\tlet over_time = (hours_worked - 40) * (hourly_pay * 1.5);\t\treturn standard_pay + over_time;\t\t}\treturn hourly_pay * hours_worked;\t}console.log(staff_pay(45, 10));\t\t\t\tHelper functionsIt possible to return a value of a function inside another function which is known as a 'helper' function. For example, say we wanted to convert hours into seconds. For the basis of this exercise I have broken in into two functions - the first converting hours to minutes and the second converting hours to seconds. Note how the function returns the result of another function call.function minutes_to_seconds(minutes)\t{\tlet seconds = minutes * 60;\treturn seconds;\t}function hours_to_minutes(hours)\t{\tlet minutes = hours * 60;\treturn minutes_to_seconds(minutes);\t}\tconsole.log(hours_to_minutes(8));\t\t\t\tFunction expressionsFunction expressions typically have no name, (functions with no name are called anonymous function) and are often stored in a variable. Lets take a look at an example.const bin_day = function(day)\t{\tif (day == 'thursday')\t\t{\t\tconsole.log('Take bins out');\t\t}\telse\t\t{\t\tconsole.log('Do not take bins out');\t\t}\t}\tbin_day('thursday');\tbin_day('wednesday');\t\t\t\tNote that we are assigning the variable to the function - it is a reference to the function and thus we can invoke the function by calling the variable with parenthesis and passing a parameter.Arrow functionsAs of ES6, arrow function syntax was introduced. This removed the requirement to use the keyword 'function' in replacement for '=>'. Using our function expression above as an example, we remove the keyword 'function' add the parameters and then use '=>' followed by the logic inside of brackets.const bin_day = (day) =>\t{\tif (day == 'thursday')\t\t{\t\tconsole.log('Take bins out');\t\t}\telse\t\t{\t\tconsole.log('Do not take bins out');\t\t}\t}\tbin_day('thursday');\tbin_day('wednesday');\t\t\t\tArrow syntax goes even further depending upon the parameters required and if the line spans multiple lines.If there is only one parameter, the function does not parenthesis. The other two must have parenthesis.const function_name = () => {};const function_name = param_one => {}; # functions taking a single parameter do not parenthesisconst function_name = (param_one, param_two) => {};\t\t\t\tIf the code spans a single line, you do not need to implicitly tell the function to return a result - it does it on its own. If the code spans multiple lines then a return keyword must be used (if you require the result to be returned).const function_name = param_one => param_one + param_one;const function_name = param_one =>\t{\tconst sum = param_one + param_one;\treturn sum;\t}\t\t\t\tScopeScope refers to where variables can be accessed from within some code. Some variables, known as 'global scope' can be accessed from anywhere within your program, whereas others will only be accessible within a given block of code (inside of brackets like a function, condition statement etc.)Block scopeBlock scope means variables can only be accessed via the block - that is anything with the brackets. For example, take a function with a variable declared inside the function. This has block scope. If you try to access this variable outside of the block you will get an error.function test_scope()\t{\tlet block = 'variable with block scope';\tconsole.log(block);\t}test_scope(); # returns 'variable with block scope'console.log(block); # returns error\t\t\t\tGlobal scopeVariables declared outside of a blocks. They can be accessed anywhere in the program including inside of blocks.let global_scope = 'this variable is global scope';function test_scope()\t{\tconsole.log(global_scope);\t}test_scope(); # logs 'this variable is global scope'console.log(global_scope); # logs 'this variable is global scope'\t\t\t\tScope pollutionScope pollution is the concept of variables over writing one another - say you have a global variable which is accidently reassigned inside a block.let scope_pollution = 'this variable is global scope';function test_scope()\t{\tscope_pollution = 'our variable has changed!'\tconsole.log(scope_pollution);\t}\tconsole.log(scope_pollution);\ttest_scope();\tconsole.log(scope_pollution);\t\t\t\tHigher order functionsA higher order function is a function that either accepts another function as a parameter, returns a function or both. When we pass a function in as a parameter we do not invoke the function - invoking would evaluate the return of that function call. Instead we pass in the function with no parenthesis and invoke inside higher order function.const timeFuncRuntime = funcParameter =>\t{ let t1 = Date.now(); funcParameter(); let t2 = Date.now(); console.log(t2 - t1);\t}function time_trial()\t{\tfor (let i =0; i < 1000; i++)\t\t{\t\tconsole.log(i);\t\t}\t}timeFuncRuntime(time_trial);\t\t\t\tNote, we could have also assigned a function to a variable and passed the variable through the function in the same manner. As the variable if referencing the function it would still be invoked in the higher order function.const timeFuncRuntime = funcParameter =>\t{\tlet t1 = Date.now();\tfuncParameter();\tlet t2 = Date.now();\tconsole.log(t2 - t1);\t}const time_trial = function()\t{\tfor (let i =0; i < 1000; i++)\t\t{\t\tconsole.log(i);\t\t}\t}timeFuncRuntime(time_trial);\t\t\t\tCategoriesPython programmingPython basicsPython packagesData scienceSEOSEOWeb developmentJavaScriptCSSPHPHTMLSQLPopular postsNumpy basicsMatplotlib basicsPandas basicsPandas basics- part 2Python functions overviewList, dictionary & generator comprehensionMySQL & SQL in PythonCategorising keywords at scale with NLTKSimple Python web crawler with SQLiteCrawling sites using AJAX with SeleniumSitemap  |    Learning Resources  |    Copyright © charlieojackson.co.uk 2019 |\tJS Test \n","Total links count: 34 \n","\n","Loop Counter: 77 - Crawling: https://charlieojackson.co.uk/?search=javascript+functions \n","Page title: Charlie Jackson | Blogging about Python programming, SEO and web development \n","Page description: The blog of Charlie Jackson; SEO, Python programming, web development tutorials and code examples. \n","Page contents: Charlie Jackson | Blogging about Python programming, SEO and web developmentCharlie JacksonAbout me            (current)PortfolioSEO, Python programming and web developmentJavaScript functionsIn this post we look at the basics of JavaScript functions.Read More → Posted: 16-05-2019 Tagged: javascript,  javascript functions← Older SearchCategoriesPython programmingPython basicsPython packagesData scienceSEOSEOWeb developmentJavaScriptCSSPHPHTMLSQLPopular postsNumpy basicsMatplotlib basicsPandas basicsPandas basics- part 2Python functions overviewList, dictionary & generator comprehensionMySQL & SQL in PythonCategorising keywords at scale with NLTKSimple Python web crawler with SQLiteCrawling sites using AJAX with SeleniumSitemap  |    Learning Resources  |    Copyright © charlieojackson.co.uk 2019 |\tJS Test \n","Total links count: 29 \n","\n","Loop Counter: 78 - Crawling: https://charlieojackson.co.uk/javascript/js-array-basics.php \n","Page title: JavaScript arrays | Charlie Jackson \n","Page description: In this post we look at the basics of JavaScript arrays. \n","Page contents: JavaScript arrays | Charlie JacksonCharlie JacksonAbout me            (current)PortfolioJavaScript arrays            by            Charlie JacksonPosted on 16 May 2019 at 11:00 AMIn this tutorial we'll be focusing specifically on JavaScript arrays starting from the very basics and gradually covering properties and methods of arrays.What is an arrayIndexing arraysUpdating arraysNested arraysReassigning arraysArray properties / attributesArray methodsMutator methodsIteration methodsLooping through arraysUsing arrays with functionsWhat is an arrayStoring data is a fundamental concept in programming. In JavaScript we can store data in an array - this is essentially the same as a having a list. You can store any data type including strings, Booleans, integers, floats and objects. Furthermore, you can nest data within a array to make more complex data structures. To create an array, you simply declare your variable and assign to '[]'let shopping_list = ['onions', 'garlic', 'chilli','ginger']        Indexing arraysYou can access given elements within an array via their index with bracket notation. JavaScript arrays are zero indexed - so they begin at 0 instead of 1. Using our 'shopping_list' variable above we can access the given items via their index:let shopping_list = ['onions', 'garlic', 'chilli','ginger']console.log(shopping_list[0]); // returns 'onions'console.log(shopping_list[2]); // returns 'chilli'\t\t\t\tNested arraysArrays can also be nested - i.e. putting one array into another. To retrieve an item inside a nested array you can chain the index values together.let numbers = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]];let numbers_1 = numbers[0];let numbers_2 = numbers[1];let numbers_3 = numbers[2];console.log(numbers_1); // returns [1,2,3]console.log(numbers[0][1]); returns 2\t\t\t\tUpdating arraysData within the array can be updated by assigning the given item to a new value.let shopping_list = ['onions', 'garlic', 'chilli','ginger']shopping_list[3] = 'lemon grass';console.log(shopping_list); // returns ['onions', 'garlic', 'chilli','lemon grass'];\t\t\tReassigning arrays - difference in 'let' and 'const'Variables in JavaScript are declared using 'let' or 'const' - the difference being that variables declared with 'let' can be changed whereas 'const' must remain the same. This is concept is true for arrays. However, arrays are always mutable even when declared with 'const' - by mutable, I mean as we have updated the array above. See the two examples - the first showing reassignment, the second showing array mutability.Reassignment test:let root_vegetables = ['carot', 'potatoe', 'squash'];const fruit = ['lemon', 'lime', 'apple'];// reassignment for variable declared using 'let'root_vegetables = ['pumpkin'];console.log(root_vegetables); // returns 'pumpkin'// reassignment attempt for variable declared using 'const'const fruit = ['pineapple'];console.log(fruit);  // returns error - Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable\t\t\tMutability test:let root_vegetables = ['carot', 'potatoe', 'squash'];const fruit = ['lemon', 'lime', 'apple'];root_vegetables[0] = 'pumpkin';fruit[0] = 'pineapple';console.log(fruit); // returns ['pumpkin', 'potatoe', 'squash'];console.log(root_vegetables); // returns ['pineapple', 'lime', 'apple'];\t\t\tArray properties / attributesArrays have built in properties which you can access with dot notation - i.e. 'array.length'. There are a number of array properties which can be found at Mozilla Developer Network.let fruit = ['apple', 'bananna'];console.log(fruit.length); // returns 2\t\t\t\tArray methodsArrays also have built in methods to do things such as add, remove, slice an array. A method is essentially the same as a function but it is tied specifically to the array. To call a method you first specify the array followed by dot notation and then by the method name - i.e. 'array.pop()'. Note you must provide the parenthesis at the end (as you would a function) - the parenthesis are the difference between calling an property / attribute and a method.Mutator methodsAs suggested in the title, mutator methods change the array - this can be by adding new items, removing items, slicing items and many more.let fruit = ['apple', 'bananna'];// push method - adds item to the end of the arrayfruit.push('orange');console.log(fruit); // returns ['apple', 'bananna', 'orange']// pop method - removes item from the end of the arrayfruit.pop();console.log(fruit); // returns ['apple', 'bananna'] - orange was removed// shift method - removes item from the start of the arrayfruit.shift();console.log(fruit); // returns ['bananna']\t\t\t\tIteration methodsIteration methods are ways to loop through the array to produce the desired output. They are slightly more complex in nature. The syntax is similar - first you specify the array and then you call the method. However, the iteration methods take callback functions as their parameters. Lets take a look at an example usin the 'forEach()' method..foreach() method:const fruits = ['apple', 'bananna', 'orange'];fruits.forEach(function(fruit)\t{\tconsole.log(fruit); // returns apple, bananna, orange\t});\t\t\t\tFirstly we call the 'forEach()' method on the array. We then pass a callback function as the parameter - this means each iteration is passed into the callback function parameter. Note, you could refactor the callback function as below (see my JavaScript functions tutorial for more information).const fruits = ['apple', 'bananna', 'orange'];fruits.forEach(fruit => console.log(fruit));\t\t\t\tAnother type of iteration method is the 'map()' method. This works nearly exactly the same way as 'forEach()' method accept it returns a new array. If you know Python, it is similar to list comprehension..map() method:const fruits = ['apple', 'bananna', 'orange'];const fruits_uppercase = fruits.map(function(fruit)\t{\treturn fruit.toUpperCase();\t});console.log(fruits_uppercase); // returns ['APPLE', 'BANANNA', 'ORANGE'];// In one line of code:// const fruits_uppercase = fruits.map(fruit => fruit.toUpperCase());\t\t\t\tAnother common method is the '.filter()' method. Like the .map() method it also returns an array but uses conditional logic to filter items out of the array..filter() method:const fruits = ['apple', 'bananna', 'orange'];const fruits_filter = fruits.filter(function(fruit)\t{\treturn fruit.length > 5;\t});console.log(fruits_filter); // returns [\"bananna\", \"orange\"]\t\t\t\tThere are a number of other array methods - you can find these at Mozilla Developer Network.Looping through arraysKnow we know how to access items in an array using its index as well as calling array properties, we can loop through an array. First, we start by creating the array. Then we start a for loop - we create a new variable called 'i' (for 'iteration' - this is a convention), specify the condition using the array property 'length' and increment 'i' after every loop. We then access each item in the array using its index based upon 'i'.let fruit = ['apple', 'bananna', 'orange'];for (let i=0; i < fruit.length; i++)\t{\tconsole.log(fruit[i]); // returns apple, bananna, orange\t}\t\t\t\tUsing arrays with functionsArrays can also be passed into a function as the parameter. Within the function the array methods can be called to make changes to the array.Removing an item to an array using a function:let fruit = ['apple', 'bananna', 'orange'];function remove_item(arr)\t{\tarr.pop();\t}remove_item(fruit);console.log(fruit); // returns ['apple', 'bananna']\t\t\t\tAdding an item to an array using a function:let fruit = ['apple', 'bananna', 'orange'];function add_item(arr, fruit)\t{\tarr.push(fruit);\t}add_item(fruit, 'grapes');console.log(fruit); // returns [\"apple\", \"bananna\", \"orange\", \"grapes\"]\t\t\t\tCategoriesPython programmingPython basicsPython packagesData scienceSEOSEOWeb developmentJavaScriptCSSPHPHTMLSQLPopular postsNumpy basicsMatplotlib basicsPandas basicsPandas basics- part 2Python functions overviewList, dictionary & generator comprehensionMySQL & SQL in PythonCategorising keywords at scale with NLTKSimple Python web crawler with SQLiteCrawling sites using AJAX with SeleniumSitemap  |    Learning Resources  |    Copyright © charlieojackson.co.uk 2019 |\tJS Test \n","Total links count: 40 \n","\n","Loop Counter: 79 - Crawling: https://charlieojackson.co.uk/?search=javascript+arrays \n","Page title: Charlie Jackson | Blogging about Python programming, SEO and web development \n","Page description: The blog of Charlie Jackson; SEO, Python programming, web development tutorials and code examples. \n","Page contents: Charlie Jackson | Blogging about Python programming, SEO and web developmentCharlie JacksonAbout me            (current)PortfolioSEO, Python programming and web developmentJavaScript arraysIn this post we look at the basics of JavaScript arrays.Read More → Posted: 16-05-2019 Tagged: javascript,  javascript arrays← Older SearchCategoriesPython programmingPython basicsPython packagesData scienceSEOSEOWeb developmentJavaScriptCSSPHPHTMLSQLPopular postsNumpy basicsMatplotlib basicsPandas basicsPandas basics- part 2Python functions overviewList, dictionary & generator comprehensionMySQL & SQL in PythonCategorising keywords at scale with NLTKSimple Python web crawler with SQLiteCrawling sites using AJAX with SeleniumSitemap  |    Learning Resources  |    Copyright © charlieojackson.co.uk 2019 |\tJS Test \n","Total links count: 29 \n","\n","Loop Counter: 80 - Crawling: https://charlieojackson.co.uk/sql/sql-basics-with-sqlite.php \n","Page title: SQL basics with SQLite | Charlie Jackson \n","Page description: In this post we look at the basics of a database including creating a database in SQLite, creating tables, selecting data and removing data. \n","Page contents: SQL basics with SQLite | Charlie JacksonCharlie JacksonAbout me            (current)PortfolioSQL basics with SQLite            by            Charlie JacksonPosted on April 11, 2019 at 19:00 PMIn this tutorial we'll be going through the basic CRUD (create, read, update and delete) functions to a database.Installing SQLite browserCreating a database and inserting dataSelecting data from a databaseDeleting data from a databaseSummaryInstalling SQLite browserFor this tutorial we will be using SQLite - a light weight, easy to use/install database which will give us everything required to go through the basics for starting out with databases. It's worth pointing out there are many other types of databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle... the list goes on, although for this tutorial we'll look specifically at SQLite. Before we get started you'll want to download DB viewer for SQLite - this will provide us with a nice interface to play around with. Simply download from the link above, and the once downloaded open 'DB Browser (SQL)' from the start menu and you should be greeted with a screen as depicted below.Creating a database and inserting dataTo create your first database, click on the 'new database' button - this will prompt you to save a new database which you should do. It will then prompt you to create your first table - cancel out of this as we want to write SQL statements directly. Head to the 'execute SQL' tab. We'll start by creating a table named 'Persons' which will have personal information about users.CREATE TABLE Persons (\tPersonID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\tFirstName varchar(255),\tLastName varchar(255)\t);\t\t\t\tEnter the SQL above into the 'execute SQL' and press the 'play' button and all things being well you'll have created a table. SQL has been specifically designed so its wonderfully easy to understand just from reading it - i.e. in the SQL above, we have created a new table with the name 'Persons', and given it 3 fields - each field accepts a data type (in our example either an integer or varchar with a length which means a string up to a certain number of characters). We can know add some users to our 'Persons' table - the syntax being INSERT INTO [table name] ([table columns]) VALUES ([values]);.INSERT INTO Persons (LastName, FirstName) VALUES ('Charlie','Jackson');INSERT INTO Persons (LastName, FirstName) VALUES ('Scott','Jackson');INSERT INTO Persons (LastName, FirstName) VALUES ('Dave','Jackson');INSERT INTO Persons (LastName, FirstName) VALUES ('Audrey','Plastiras');INSERT INTO Persons (LastName, FirstName) VALUES ('Nikki','Plastiras');INSERT INTO Persons (LastName, FirstName) VALUES ('Dave','Plastiras');INSERT INTO Persons (LastName, FirstName) VALUES ('Grace','Plastiras');\t\t\t\tSelecting data from the databaseNow we have a database and a table with data in it, we can pull the data out using a 'select' SQL statement - the syntax is as follows: SELECT * FROM [table name];. We can go one stage further using the 'where' conditional statement. For example, we can retrieve all the users with the surname 'Jackson' with the by executing the following SQL statement.SELECT * FROM Persons WHERE LastName = 'Jackson'# returns: Charlie, Dave and Scott\t\t\t\tNote, in addition to the 'where' clause we can also use 'and' and 'or' operators to select more data.SELECT * FROM Persons WHERE FirstName = 'Charlie' or FirstName = 'Scott'# returns: Charlie and Scott\t\t\t\tUpdating data in a databaseIt's common to need to update data in a database - for example take user passwords or address which are stored in databases - users often forgot their password and subsequently need to reset them. This is a typical example where we want to keep the existing data but update the password. Using our example, we'll say someone changes their name. The syntax is: UPDATE [table name] SET [table column] = 'some value' WHERE [table column] = 'some value';.UPDATE Persons SET LastName = 'Jackson' WHERE FirstName = 'Audrey';SELECT * FROM Persons WHERE LastName = 'Jackson'# returns: Charlie, Dave, Scott and Audrey\t\t\t\tDeleting data from a databaseThe final part of the CRUD functionality is to delete some data from a database. Again, this follows the simple syntax : DELETE FROM [table name] WHERE [table column] = 'some value';.DELETE FROM Persons WHERE FirstName = 'Charlie';SELECT * FROM Persons;# returns: Dave J, Scott, Audrey, Nikki, Grace, Dave P\t\t\t\tSummaryLastly, it's worth pointing out that CRUD applications have a backend language such as PHP or Python which can take user inputs from a form and parse into an SQL statement. There are many things on a day to day basis which require databases but to give you a few examples:Signing up to mailing list - 'insert' statementunsubscribing from a mailing list - 'delete' statement (supposedly)Logging into a site - 'select' statementForgotten password - 'update' statementThis is just a few simple examples to give a flavour of the simple 'CRUD' applications but nearly all large sites online will have a database behind them. Many CMS's like WordPress store all web content in databases and return the content to a page when a URL is selected.CategoriesPython programmingPython basicsPython packagesData scienceSEOSEOWeb developmentJavaScriptCSSPHPHTMLSQLPopular postsNumpy basicsMatplotlib basicsPandas basicsPandas basics- part 2Python functions overviewList, dictionary & generator comprehensionMySQL & SQL in PythonCategorising keywords at scale with NLTKSimple Python web crawler with SQLiteCrawling sites using AJAX with SeleniumSitemap  |    Learning Resources  |    Copyright © charlieojackson.co.uk 2019 |\tJS Test \n","Total links count: 32 \n","\n","Loop Counter: 81 - Crawling: https://charlieojackson.co.uk/?search=sql+basics \n","Page title: Charlie Jackson | Blogging about Python programming, SEO and web development \n","Page description: The blog of Charlie Jackson; SEO, Python programming, web development tutorials and code examples. \n","Page contents: Charlie Jackson | Blogging about Python programming, SEO and web developmentCharlie JacksonAbout me            (current)PortfolioSEO, Python programming and web developmentSQL basics with SQLiteIn this post we look at the basics of a database including creating a database in SQLite, creating tables, selecting data and removing data.Read More → Posted: 11-04-2019 Tagged: sql basics,  sqlite← Older SearchCategoriesPython programmingPython basicsPython packagesData scienceSEOSEOWeb developmentJavaScriptCSSPHPHTMLSQLPopular postsNumpy basicsMatplotlib basicsPandas basicsPandas basics- part 2Python functions overviewList, dictionary & generator comprehensionMySQL & SQL in PythonCategorising keywords at scale with NLTKSimple Python web crawler with SQLiteCrawling sites using AJAX with SeleniumSitemap  |    Learning Resources  |    Copyright © charlieojackson.co.uk 2019 |\tJS Test \n","Total links count: 29 \n","\n","Loop Counter: 82 - Crawling: https://charlieojackson.co.uk/sql/sql-basics.php \n","Loop Counter: 83 - Crawling: https://charlieojackson.co.uk/python/python-functions.php#lambdas \n","Page title: Python functions | Charlie Jackson \n","Page description: Take a deep dive into functions in Python.

It will start with the basics and gradually get more complex. Topics covered include:Basic functions- no parameters, with parameters and default parametersNested functionsScope*args and **kwargsLambdas, maps and filtersFunctions and Panda DataFramesCode takeawayBefore diving into creating functions, it's worth thinking about what a function actually is. In essence, it's a code that does a very specific task. So instead of creating a long script that does lots of things, you want to break it up into lots of functions that do specific jobs simply and efficiently .Basic functionsIn their most simplest  forms, you can create a function with no parameters.>>> def hello():      print('hello')>>> hello()'hello'            The code above simply prints out 'hello' - you can also 'return' some data and store it in a variable, i.e. so you can use what is returned from the function later on in your program.>>> def hello():      return 'hello'>>> hello = hello()>>> hello'hello'            Moving on from the simplest function, we can then create a functiona which take parameters and use unique data that is passed to the function.>>> def hello(name):      return 'hello ' + name + ' you ledge'>>> hello('james')'hello james you ledge'>>> hello('scott')'hello scott you ledge'            When you create a function you can use as many parameters as you want. In addition you can also return as much data as required.>>> def hello(fname, lname):      nice_greeting = 'hello ' + fname + ' ' + lname + ' you ledge'      unpleasant_greeting = 'hello ' + fname + ' ' + lname + ' you idiot'      responses = (nice_greeting, unpleasant_greeting) # this creates a tuple named responses      return responses>>> nice, unpleasant = hello('james', 'bond')>>> nice'hello james bond you ledge'>>> unpleasant'hello james bond you idiot'            Lastly, you can have default parameters if nothing is passed when the function is called.>>> def hello(fname, repeat=5):      name_repeat = fname * repeat      return name_repeat>>> hello('james')'jamesjamesjamesjamesjames'>>> hello('james', repeat=10)'jamesjamesjamesjamesjamesjamesjamesjamesjamesjames'            Nested functionsNesting a function means to put one function into another function.>>> def hello(fname, lname):  \t  def nice(name):  \t\t  return \"alright \" + name + \" you ledge\"    return nice(fname + \" \" + lname)>>> hello('james', 'bond')'alright james bond you ledge'            Scope - LEGB ruleWhen functions start getting nested and or require data that is not within the function itself, we are going to hit problems with scope. Scope essentially means where a variable can be accessed from. Python will look within each scope in the order: local, global and then built in - abbreviated to LEGB.Local scope -created within a functionEnclosing scope -to do with nested functionsGlobal scope - created in the body of a scriptBuilt ins - i.e. the functions that are built in with Python like print() len()Global scopeWhere a variable is in the main body of the program it can be accessed from anywhere, including from within functions. In the example below, we can see the variable 'x' is created in the main body of the script and then used within the function 'add()'.>>> x = 10>>> def add(number):    \tadd_numbers = number + x    \treturn add_numbers>>> add(5)15            In the function above, the program first looked in the local scope (i.e. within the function) and then in the global scope to find the variable 'x'. We see this in the following example where 'x' is located in the local scope.>>> x = 50>>> def add(number):      x = 10      add_numbers = number + x      return add_numbers>>> add(5)15>>> x50            Local scopeAs noted above, the local scope is where a variable is accessible only from within the function. Calling the variable outside of the function will return a 'NameError'.>>> def local_variable():      y = 10      return y>>> y + 10Traceback (most recent call last):File \"pyshell#111\", line 1, in moduley + 10NameError: name 'y' is not defined            You can make a local variable global by using the keyword 'global'. This means the value now has global scope.>>> x = 50>>> def add():    \tglobal x    \tx = 10    \treturn x>>> x50>>> add()10>>> x10            Built-in scopeBuilt in is the final place Python looks when interpreting data. Typically you will not have any issues with built-in scope but on occasions you may accidentally write a function which overwrites a built-in function. Take the following example where I have named my function 'min' which subsquently means I can't use the builtin function 'min()'.    >>> lst = [1,2,3,4,5]>>> min_lst = min(lst)>>> min_lst1>>> def min():\t     pass>>> min()>>> min_lst = min(lst)Traceback (most recent call last):  File \"pyshell#151\", line 1, in     min_lst = min(lst)TypeError: min() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given>>>            Enclosing scopeEnclosing scope happens when there are nested functions; Python will first look in the local scope, if it cannot find a local variable it will look within the enclosing scope which is the within the function that it is nested. Lets look at the following example: >>> def outer():      x = 'outer x'      def inner():      \tx = 'inner x'      \tprint(x)      inner()      print(x)>>> outer()inner xouter x            Both functions have a variable named \"x\" with local scope so you see the inner and the outer printed. If we remove the inner x, the enclosed scope will be used and the inner x prints outer x as depicted below.>>> def outer():      x = 'outer x'        def inner():          print(x)      inner()      print(x)>>> outer()outer xouter x              Using the keyword 'nonlocal' allows the current scope to be passed to the enclosed scope (but not the global scope) as follows:>>> def outer():      x = 'outer x'        def inner():        nonlocal x        x = 'inner x'        print(x)      inner()      print(x)>>> outer()inner xinner x              Summary of scopeRemember python will always look for scope within the LEGB sequence (local, enclosed, global, built in). The final example shows you scope across local, enclosed and global.>>> x = 'global x'>>> def outer():    x = 'outer x'    def inner():      x = 'inner x'      print(x)      inner()    print(x)>>> outer()inner xouter x>>> x'global x'>>>              *args*args allows you to pass in an unspecified number of arguments to the function. Note, the term 'args' is not a Python keyword but a convention so it can actually be named whatever you like although its best to stick to convention. The asterisk tells python that the function accepts an undefined number of arguments.>>> def add_numbers(*args):\t\ttotal = 0\t\tfor number in args:\t\t\ttotal = total + number\t\treturn total>>> add_numbers(1,2,3)6>>> add_numbers(10,50,6)66\t\t\t\t\t\t**kargs**kwargs ,as you might have guest, are very similar to *args except they allow you to pass an undefined number of keyword arguments to the function. kwargs are a dictionary, so can be looped through and accessed using the dictionary syntax.>>> def football_player(**kwargs):\tfor key, value in kwargs.items():\t\tprint(key + \" : \" + value)>>> football_player(name='Harry Kane', club=\"Tottenham Hotspur FC\")name : Harry Kaneclub : Tottenham Hotspur FC>>> football_player(name='Harry Kane', club=\"Tottenham Hotspur FC\", position=\"Stricker\")name : Harry Kaneclub : Tottenham Hotspur FCposition : Stricker>>>\t\t\t\t\t\tLambdasLambdas allow functions to be written quickly on the fly - for this reason they should be used with caution as a normal function will often be better. To use a lambda function you must specify the 'lambda' keyword followed by the names of the variables in the function and then finally by what you would like to do with the variables and the function to return.>>> add_numbers = (lambda x, y: x * y)>>> add_numbers(5,6)30>>> add_numbers(10, 5)50\t\t\t\t\t\tNotice the syntax; first you specify the lambda keyword, then the variables and finally what should be returned.Anonymous functions (map() and lambda functions)Lambdas are most useful when they are anonymously embedded within larger expressions using 'map()'. 'map()' always you to apply a function to an object, such as a list. First you specify the keyword 'map' followed by the 'lambda' keyword and syntax (the variables and what should be returned) and lastly the object to which the function should be mapped to.>>> lst = [1,2,3,4,5]>>> square = map(lambda x: x*x, lst)>>> squaremap object at 0x03664E50>>> list(square)[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen the expression is validated it returns a map object - this can then be converted to a list using the built-in function 'list()'.filter()Using the 'filter()' function allows you to filter out data that does not satisfy a certain criteria. To use 'filter()' you first specify the 'filter' keyword, then the lambda function and lastly the object you would like to map the function to.>>> lst = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]>>> square = filter(lambda x: x > 4, lst)>>> list(square)[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\t\t\t\t\t\tUsing functions with PandasFor this final example we will count all the countries the Tottenham players originate from. First we must create the DataFrame.>>> import pandas as pd>>> players = ['Hugo Lloris', 'Kieran Trippier', 'Toby Alderweireld', 'Jan Vertonghen', 'Davinson Sanchez', 'Heung-Min Son', 'Harry Winks', 'Harry Kane', 'Erik Lamela', 'Victor Wanyama', 'Michel Vorm', 'Georges-Kévin Nkoudou', 'Eric Dier', 'Kyle Walker-Peters', 'Moussa Sissoko', 'Fernando Llorente', 'Dele Alli', 'Juan Foyth', 'Paulo Gazzaniga', 'Christian Eriksen', 'Serge Aurier', 'Josh Onomah', 'Lucas Moura', 'Ben Davies', 'Cameron Carter-Vickers', 'Vincent Janssen']>>> locations = ['Nice, France', 'Bury, England', 'Wilrijk, Belgium', 'Sint-Niklaas, Belgium', 'Caloto, Colombia', 'Chuncheon, South Korea', 'Hemel Hempstead, England', 'London, England', 'Carapachay, Argentina','Nairobi, Kenya', 'Nieuwegein, Netherlands','Versailles, France', 'Cheltenham, England', 'Edmonton, England', 'Le Blanc-Mesnil, France', 'Pamplona, Spain', 'Milton Keynes, England', 'La Plata, Argentina', 'Murphy, Argentina', 'Middelfart, Denmark', 'Ouragahio, Cote dIvoire', 'London, England', 'São Paulo, Brazil', 'Neath, Wales', 'Southend-on-Sea, England', 'Heesch, Netherlands']>>> data_combined = {'players': players, 'locations': locations}>>> tottenham_squad = pd.DataFrame(data_combined)>>> tottenham_squad                   players                 locations0              Hugo Lloris              Nice, France1          Kieran Trippier             Bury, England2        Toby Alderweireld          Wilrijk, Belgium3           Jan Vertonghen     Sint-Niklaas, Belgium4         Davinson Sanchez          Caloto, Colombia5            Heung-Min Son    Chuncheon, South Korea6              Harry Winks  Hemel Hempstead, England7               Harry Kane           London, England8              Erik Lamela     Carapachay, Argentina9           Victor Wanyama            Nairobi, Kenya10             Michel Vorm   Nieuwegein, Netherlands11   Georges-Kévin Nkoudou        Versailles, France12               Eric Dier       Cheltenham, England13      Kyle Walker-Peters         Edmonton, England14          Moussa Sissoko   Le Blanc-Mesnil, France15       Fernando Llorente           Pamplona, Spain16               Dele Alli    Milton Keynes, England17              Juan Foyth       La Plata, Argentina18         Paulo Gazzaniga         Murphy, Argentina19       Christian Eriksen       Middelfart, Denmark20            Serge Aurier   Ouragahio, Cote dIvoire21             Josh Onomah           London, England22             Lucas Moura         São Paulo, Brazil23              Ben Davies              Neath, Wales24  Cameron Carter-Vickers  Southend-on-Sea, England25         Vincent Janssen       Heesch, Netherlands\t\t\t\t\t\tNow the DataFrame is created, we create the function which accepts a DataFrame and has a default parameter for the DataFrame column set to 'locations'. The function takes the column, splits the location by ',' to only get the country from the location and adds to a dictionary to count all the occurrences of each country. Note, I also applied a try and except in case the data is in the wrong format and breaks the code.>>> def count_countries(df, col_name='locations'):    \"\"\"return all the countries and count for the tottenham first team\"\"\"    country_count = {}    countries = df[col_name]    for country in countries:        try:            country = country.split(',')[1]            if country in country_count.keys():                country_count[country] += 1            else:                country_count[country] = 1        except:            continue    return(country_count)>>> count_countries(tottenham_squad){' France': 3, ' England': 8, ' Belgium': 2, ' Colombia': 1, ' South Korea': 1, ' Argentina': 3, ' Kenya': 1, ' Netherlands': 2, ' Spain': 1, ' Denmark': 1, ' Cote dIvoire': 1, ' Brazil': 1, ' Wales': 1}>>>\t\t\t\t\t\tCode takeawayimport pandas as pd# tottenham squad dataplayers = ['Hugo Lloris', 'Kieran Trippier', 'Toby Alderweireld', 'Jan Vertonghen', 'Davinson Sanchez', 'Heung-Min Son', 'Harry Winks', 'Harry Kane', 'Erik Lamela', 'Victor Wanyama', 'Michel Vorm', 'Georges-Kévin Nkoudou', 'Eric Dier', 'Kyle Walker-Peters', 'Moussa Sissoko', 'Fernando Llorente', 'Dele Alli', 'Juan Foyth', 'Paulo Gazzaniga', 'Christian Eriksen', 'Serge Aurier', 'Josh Onomah', 'Lucas Moura', 'Ben Davies', 'Cameron Carter-Vickers', 'Vincent Janssen']locations = ['Nice, France', 'Bury, England', 'Wilrijk, Belgium', 'Sint-Niklaas, Belgium', 'Caloto, Colombia', 'Chuncheon, South Korea', 'Hemel Hempstead, England', 'London, England', 'Carapachay, Argentina','Nairobi, Kenya', 'Nieuwegein, Netherlands','Versailles, France', 'Cheltenham, England', 'Edmonton, England', 'Le Blanc-Mesnil, France', 'Pamplona, Spain', 'Milton Keynes, England', 'La Plata, Argentina', 'Murphy, Argentina', 'Middelfart, Denmark', 'Ouragahio, Cote dIvoire', 'London, England', 'São Paulo, Brazil', 'Neath, Wales', 'Southend-on-Sea, England', 'Heesch, Netherlands']# combine data within a dictionarydata_combined = {'player': players, 'location': locations}# create DataFrametottenham_squad = pd.DataFrame(data_combined)def count_countries(df, col_name='location'):    \"\"\"return all the countries and count for the tottenham first team\"\"\"    country_count = {}    countries = df[col_name]    for country in countries:        try:            country = country.split(',')[1]            if country in country_count.keys():                country_count[country] += 1            else:                country_count[country] = 1        except:            continue    return(country_count)print(count_countries(tottenham_squad))\t\t\t\t\t\tCategoriesPython programmingPython basicsPython packagesData scienceSEOSEOWeb developmentJavaScriptCSSPHPHTMLSQLPopular postsNumpy basicsMatplotlib basicsPandas basicsPandas basics- part 2Python functions overviewList, dictionary & generator comprehensionMySQL & SQL in PythonCategorising keywords at scale with NLTKSimple Python web crawler with SQLiteCrawling sites using AJAX with SeleniumSitemap  |    Learning Resources  |    Copyright © charlieojackson.co.uk 2019 |\tJS Test \n","Total links count: 34 \n","\n","Loop Counter: 84 - Crawling: https://charlieojackson.co.uk/index.php?page=4 \n","Page title: Charlie Jackson | Blogging about Python programming, SEO and web development \n","Page description: The blog of Charlie Jackson;
